## From Ørsted’s Write-downs to Project Success
### Introducing the Simple Success Simulator

The recent Ørsted case, where significant write-downs shocked the market, raises a crucial question: How can organizations better anticipate and prevent such catastrophic project failures? At EthiQuest, we’ve developed an experimental tool to help leaders understand and visualize the complex dynamics that lead to project success or failure.

Why Another Project Management Tool?
The statistics are sobering: only 0.5% of major projects deliver on time, budget, and expected benefits. This isn’t just about poor planning or execution – it’s about fundamental misalignment between incentives, governance, and reality.

Our Simple Success Simulator offers a unique perspective on this challenge by illustrating how organizational choices impact project outcomes. It’s not a crystal ball, but rather a tool for reflection and discussion about how we create conditions for project success.

What Makes Projects Fail?
Through our simulator, we’ve identified several critical insights:

The Incentive Trap: When sales bonuses dominate implementation bonuses (80/20 split), the risk of catastrophic failures increases by 300%. This creates a dangerous misalignment between those who sell and those who must deliver.
The Governance Shield: Strong project governance can reduce “black swan” risks by up to 70%. However, governance quality often deteriorates precisely when we need it most – during complex, high-stakes projects.
Scale Matters: Projects exceeding 70% of company value with high complexity have 5x higher failure risk. This matches Bent Flyvbjerg’s research on strategic misrepresentation in major projects.
Exploring the Dynamics
The simulator lets you experiment with four key variables:

Balance between sales and implementation incentives
Strength of project governance
Degree of external validation
Impact on estimates and results
By adjusting these parameters, you can see how different organizational choices affect:

Estimation bias
Success probability
Budget overruns
Black swan risks
Beyond the Numbers
While the simulator is based on research and real-world patterns, its real value lies in the conversations it triggers:

How do our incentive structures influence behavior?
What’s the true value of solid governance?
Why do we consistently underestimate risks?
How can we create better conditions for project success?
A Tool for Learning, Not Prediction
It’s important to note that this is an experimental model designed to illustrate principles rather than predict specific outcomes. Its purpose is to stimulate discussion and challenge our assumptions about what drives project success.

Experiment with different scenarios and see how various factors interact. The insights might challenge your assumptions about project risk management.

Looking Ahead
As organizations tackle increasingly complex projects in an AI-accelerated world, understanding these dynamics becomes crucial. The Simple Success Simulator is just one tool in our ongoing exploration of how to create better conditions for project success.
