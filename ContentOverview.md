# The Broken Compass: Ethical Leadership for Value Creation in a Chaotic World

## Book Overview

### Purpose:
"The Broken Compass" focuses on the individual leader's ethical journey in an increasingly complex and chaotic world. Through provocative examples and personal case studies, the book exposes how our ethical decision-making often fails us, not because we lack moral values, but because our internal compass is misaligned or broken by unprecedented external pressures.

The timing is critical. As leaders face unprecedented challenges from technological advancement, institutional fragmentation, and global uncertainty, the need for strong ethical leadership has never been greater. Yet, many leaders find their traditional approaches to ethical decision-making inadequate for today's challenges.

Drawing from real-world scenarios and global trends, the book demonstrates how easily our ethical compass can be thrown off course, and more importantly, how to recalibrate it for both personal leadership effectiveness and broader societal impact.

### Target Audience:
Leaders who:
- Struggle with ethical decisions in a world of competing demands
- Want to strengthen their personal moral compass in times of institutional uncertainty
- Seek to lead with authenticity and ethical clarity
- Need to navigate the challenges of AI, misinformation, and polarization
- Aim to create sustainable value while maintaining integrity

### Unique Value Proposition:
This book delivers:
- A provocative examination of personal ethical leadership failures and successes
- Practical insights into building antifragile ethical decision-making capabilities
- Real-world cases that challenge common assumptions about ethical leadership
- A framework for developing stronger personal ethical foundations
- Tools for navigating ethical challenges in today's rapid-paced, technologically transformed environment

"The Broken Compass" isn't about preaching ethicsâ€”it's about developing the personal ethical strength needed to lead effectively in an increasingly complex world, where traditional guideposts are failing.
