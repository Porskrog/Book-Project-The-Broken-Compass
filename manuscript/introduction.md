# The Fork in the Road: A Personal Journey to Ethical Leadership

## DRAFT SKETCH - TO BE EXPANDED

[Note: This will build on the existing introduction draft, enhancing it with new elements that connect to the broader themes of institutional fragmentation and antifragile ethics]

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead as I sat in the sterile conference room, surrounded by executives in crisp suits. The air was thick with anticipation. As the program manager, I knew what was coming, but that didn't make it any easier to witness.

The bids for a major public software tender were about to be revealed. Our company's offer flashed up on the screen, and my heart sank. The figure was impossibly lowâ€”less than half of our closest competitor's bid. A quick mental calculation confirmed my fears: there was no way we could deliver on this price without cutting corners, overworking our team, or outright failing to meet the project's requirements.

Yet, as I glanced around the room, I saw only grins and nods of approval. The executives were already celebrating their 'win,' patting each other on the back for this shrewd business move. In that moment, I realized I was witnessing more than just aggressive pricing or clever market strategy. This was a profound ethical failure, one that would have far-reaching consequences.

I could already envision the fallout: developers working nights and weekends to meet impossible deadlines, project managers struggling to maintain quality with insufficient resources, and ultimately, a public sector client left with subpar software that would impact countless citizens.

As the meeting adjourned and my colleagues filed out, still buzzing with excitement, I remained seated. The weight of what I'd just witnessed settled heavily on my shoulders. I was at a crossroads, facing a stark choice between complicity in this ethical breach and standing up for what I knew was right.
