# The Collapse of Global Order: When the Ground Shifts Beneath Everyone

Think the pressure on your ethical compass is just about office politics or industry trends? Think bigger. Today's leaders face an unprecedented destabilization of the entire global order—a seismic shift that makes the Cold War's rigid bipolarity look almost comforting by comparison. Welcome to leadership when the very foundations of international stability are crumbling beneath your feet.

## The New Global Disorder

Let's face the uncomfortable truth: The post-WWII international order—with its shared rules, multilateral institutions, and alliance structures—is unraveling at alarming speed. This isn't just happening "somewhere else" in diplomatic corridors. It's creating ripple effects that reach into your boardroom, your team discussions, and even your dinner table conversations.

Consider what we're witnessing:

- Longstanding allies publicly threatened and humiliated by the very superpower that once championed the alliance system
- Democratic leaders bullied in ways previously reserved for adversaries
- Territorial ambitions openly discussed using language not heard since the colonial era
- Back-channel deals that bypass established diplomatic channels and institutions
- The deliberate undermining of international organizations from within
- The normalization of rhetoric once considered beyond the pale

The most alarming aspect isn't just the behavior itself, but the rapid normalization of what would have been unthinkable just years ago. We're experiencing a real-time example of what social psychologists call "the shifting baseline syndrome"—each outrageous action or statement becomes the new normal, making the next transgression seem less shocking by comparison.

## The Assault on Institutional Truth

At the heart of this disorder is a calculated assault on institutional truth. When powerful figures can dismiss established facts as "fake news" and offer "alternative facts" instead, the very foundation of rational discourse collapses. We've moved beyond mere disagreement about interpretations to fundamental disagreement about reality itself.

I witnessed this firsthand in a conversation with a long-time friend—a rational, educated person who suddenly seemed to inhabit a completely different factual universe. When I suggested consulting independent sources to verify claims about a government efficiency initiative, he saw no need. His information source (a partisan news outlet) had told him everything he needed to know. Why complicate matters with additional perspectives?

This isn't simple confirmation bias. It's the result of an information ecosystem deliberately engineered to create alternate realities—complete with their own "experts," "evidence," and internal logic. When someone can live in such a hermetically sealed information world, conventional persuasion becomes nearly impossible.

Another colleague framed the situation as merely choosing between "the lesser of two evils"—reducing fundamental questions about democratic norms and institutional integrity to matters of partisan preference. This false equivalency is perhaps the most dangerous normalization of all, as it suggests that assaults on core democratic institutions are just another policy position over which reasonable people might disagree.

## The Leadership Whiplash

For leaders of organizations—whether businesses, non-profits, or public institutions—this creates a form of ethical whiplash. The geopolitical environment swings wildly between contradictory positions. Alliances form and dissolve overnight. Agreements mean everything until they suddenly mean nothing.

How do you plan for the long term when the international rules-based order might not exist next year? How do you maintain ethical consistency when norms are being redefined daily? How do you explain to stakeholders why you're holding to principles that powerful figures are openly flouting?

These aren't abstract questions. They manifest in immediate business dilemmas:

- Should your company continue investing in markets where rule of law is rapidly deteriorating?
- How do you navigate supply chains through regions where geopolitical alliances are shifting unpredictably?
- What stance should your organization take on contentious issues when neutrality increasingly looks like complicity?
- How do you maintain a commitment to truth in your organizational communications when "truth" itself has become contested territory?

## The False Comfort of "This Is Normal"

Perhaps the most insidious pressure comes from those who insist, "This is just how things are now" or "Everyone behaves this way." This normalization offers a seductive comfort—if this is simply the new reality, we can stop expending energy fighting it and focus on adaptation.

A senior executive I know recently rationalized ignoring contractual obligations by saying, "Look, everyone cuts corners these days. That's just business in 2025." This wasn't just an ethical compromise; it was a surrender of the very concept of ethical standards.

The normalization process happens through seemingly reasonable steps:

1. "This shocking event is an anomaly"
2. "Well, it happens more often than we thought, but it's still not typical"
3. "It's becoming common but mostly among certain types"
4. "I guess this is just how things work now"
5. "It's always been this way; we were naive before"

Each step makes the slide toward ethical collapse more comfortable—and more complete.

## The Europeanization of Moral Responsibility

For European leaders particularly, this global disorder creates a unique pressure. As American leadership becomes increasingly unpredictable and the post-WWII security architecture wobbles, European institutions and leaders face a moment of truth: Will they assert their own values-based approach to global challenges, or will they too succumb to the normalization of a might-makes-right international system?

This isn't just a question for heads of state. It cascades down to every organizational leader who must decide whether European values—commitment to human dignity, rule of law, social cohesion, environmental responsibility—will guide their decisions even when they might create competitive disadvantages in the short term.

The comfortable position of being able to operate within a stable Western consensus, anchored by predictable American leadership, is evaporating. European business and civic leaders must now decide what values they will uphold when the traditional alliances and frameworks can no longer be taken for granted.

## Your Compass in Global Disorder

So how do you maintain your ethical compass when the global magnetic field is fluctuating wildly? Here's the critical insight: In times of institutional collapse, personal and organizational integrity becomes *more* important, not less.

When traditional institutions fail to provide ethical guardrails, leaders must become those guardrails. Your commitment to truth, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship doesn't become optional during global disorder—it becomes essential.

This requires three critical capabilities:

1. **Historical Perspective**: Understanding that periods of international disorder are not new, but neither are they inevitable or permanent. Leaders with historical knowledge recognize patterns, avoid fatalism, and maintain ethical consistency through turbulence.

2. **Information Hygiene**: Developing rigorous practices for distinguishing fact from fiction, institutional knowledge from propaganda, and analysis from advocacy. This means seeking diverse, high-quality information sources even when it requires more effort.

3. **Values Articulation**: Explicitly naming and defending the values that guide your decisions, rather than assuming these are understood or shared. When the ambient environment normalizes ethical breaches, silent adherence to principles isn't enough.

## The Long View: Institutional Rebuilders

The collapse of global order creates immediate ethical pressure, but it also presents a profound opportunity: to become not just a survivor of institutional breakdown but a rebuilder of more resilient institutions.

The current disorder won't last forever. Something will replace it. The question is whether that replacement will be shaped by leaders who maintained their ethical compasses through the chaos or by those who abandoned theirs at the first sign of pressure.

This is perhaps the most important ethical choice today's leaders face: Will you be complicit in the normalization of institutional breakdown, or will you be part of rebuilding more robust, resilient, values-based institutions for the future?

The leaders who choose the rebuilding path will need more than just good intentions. They'll need frameworks for ethical decision-making that can withstand chaotic environments. They'll need tools for maintaining integrity when external pressures push toward compromise. And they'll need communities of like-minded leaders who reinforce rather than undermine their ethical commitments.

That's exactly what the remainder of this book aims to provide.

## Reflection Questions

1. How has the deterioration of the international order affected decision-making in your organization, even in seemingly unrelated areas?

2. Where have you noticed yourself normalizing behaviors or rhetoric that would have shocked you five years ago?

3. What information sources do you rely on, and how diverse are the perspectives they represent?

4. When have you fallen into the trap of equating partisan differences with fundamental questions of institutional integrity?

5. What values would you be unwilling to compromise even if doing so created competitive advantage?

Remember: The greatest threat to your ethical compass isn't direct pressure to compromise—it's the gradual normalization of compromise as simply "the way things are now." Resisting this normalization isn't just a personal ethical choice; it's a crucial act of institutional preservation for our collective future.
