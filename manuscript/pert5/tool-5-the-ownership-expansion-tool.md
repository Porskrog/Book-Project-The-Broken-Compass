# Tool 5: The Ownership Expansion Tool

## Purpose
To systematically expand the leader's sphere of responsibility beyond traditional boundaries and remove the tendency toward responsibility deflection. This tool addresses the problem of limited responsibility, where leaders only take ownership of direct actions and deflect blame for problems onto others or circumstances.

## Why Ownership Expansion Matters

As we saw in Chapter 7, the contrast between Masao Yoshida at Fukushima and the BP executives during the Deepwater Horizon disaster illustrates a fundamental truth: disasters amplify whatever responsibility orientation already exists. When the crisis hit Fukushima, Yoshida instinctively expanded his responsibility horizon. When crisis struck Deepwater Horizon, leaders immediately narrowed their responsibility focus.

You don't develop an expanded responsibility orientation during a crisis; you reveal the orientation you've already cultivated. The Ownership Expansion Tool helps you develop this orientation before you need it.

## The Ownership Expansion Framework

The framework consists of five core practices:

1. **Responsibility Horizon Mapping**: Visualizing your current and potential responsibility spheres
2. **Buck Stops Everywhere Implementation**: Redefining your approach to accountability 
3. **Problem Value Finder Activation**: Transforming problems into opportunities
4. **Blame Elimination**: Shifting focus from blame to solutions
5. **Ripple Effect Mapping**: Understanding the full scope of impact from your decisions

By mastering these practices, you can dramatically expand your responsibility horizon and create the kind of antifragile responsibility that gets stronger under pressure.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Responsibility Horizon Mapping

Most responsibility failures occur because leaders define their responsibility horizon too narrowly. This mapping exercise helps you visualize where your current boundaries lie and where they could expand.

**Exercise: Map Your Responsibility Circles**

Draw three concentric circles labeled:

1. **Core Circle (Direct Control)**: What you consider completely within your responsibility (typically your direct actions and decisions)
2. **Influence Circle (Indirect Control)**: Areas where you have some influence but typically don't claim full responsibility
3. **System Circle (Broader Accountability)**: Areas that affect your work but that you consider "someone else's responsibility"

For each circle, list the specific elements that fall within it. Be brutally honest about what you currently place in each circle.

**Example from Deepwater Horizon:**
- Core Circle: "Following my specific contractual obligations"
- Influence Circle: "Raising concerns about safety issues I observe"
- System Circle: "Overall well integrity and environmental protection"

**Example from Fukushima:**
- Core Circle: "Safety of my team and plant operations"
- Influence Circle: "Coordination with government and corporate leadership"
- System Circle: "Public safety and environmental protection"

**Expansion Practice:**
For each item in your Influence and System circles, ask:
- What would change if I moved this into my Core responsibility circle?
- What's the worst that could happen if I took full responsibility for this?
- What opportunities might emerge if I expanded my ownership here?

Select 2-3 items from outer circles that you will intentionally move into your Core circle.

### Step 2: Buck Stops Everywhere Implementation

Responsibility diffusion occurs when everyone assumes someone else will handle a problem. The "Buck Stops Everywhere" mindset counters this by cultivating the assumption that if you can see a problem, it's yours to address—regardless of whether it's "your job."

**Exercise: The No-Excuses Audit**

1. List 5-10 significant problems or challenges you're currently facing
2. For each, write down the standard excuse you might use (or have used) to explain why this isn't fully your responsibility
3. Cross out each excuse and replace it with: "I am fully responsible for this because..."
4. Complete that sentence honestly, even if it feels uncomfortable

**Example from Deepwater Horizon:**
- Problem: "Anomalous pressure test results"
- Typical Excuse: "The contractors are the technical experts on this"
- Ownership Statement: "I am fully responsible for this because the overall safety of this operation is ultimately my responsibility, regardless of which contractor performs which test."

**Example from Fukushima:**
- Problem: "Conflicting instructions from headquarters and government officials"
- Typical Excuse: "I can't be responsible for contradictory orders from above"
- Ownership Statement: "I am fully responsible for this because I have the most complete picture of the ground-level situation and must make the best judgment based on all available information."

**Implementation Plan:**
For each problem where you've claimed full responsibility:
1. Identify one specific action you'll take to address it
2. Set a deadline for that action
3. Identify who you'll inform about your expanded ownership
4. Determine how you'll measure progress

### Step 3: Problem Value Finder Activation

Most leaders see problems as threats to be avoided. Extraordinary leaders see problems as opportunities for system improvement and personal growth.

**Exercise: Problem Reframing Matrix**

Create a four-column matrix:
1. Problem Description
2. Traditional Threat Framing ("This is bad because...")
3. Value Opportunity ("This is valuable because...")
4. Action Steps to Unlock Value

For each significant problem you face, complete all columns.

**Example from Deepwater Horizon:**
- Problem: "Cement integrity test failures"
- Threat Framing: "This will delay our already behind-schedule project and cost more money"
- Value Opportunity: "This reveals a critical safety issue before it becomes catastrophic and gives us the chance to develop a more robust testing protocol"
- Action Steps: "Run comprehensive additional tests; review and revise cementing procedure; document learnings for future wells"

**Example from Fukushima:**
- Problem: "Loss of conventional cooling systems"
- Threat Framing: "We cannot maintain proper cooling of the reactor cores"
- Value Opportunity: "This forces us to develop creative alternative cooling methods that could be valuable in other emergency scenarios"
- Action Steps: "Identify all available water sources; repurpose fire trucks as pumping systems; document improvised cooling methods for future emergency protocols"

**Activation Strategy:**
1. Schedule a weekly "problem value finder" session for yourself or your team
2. Select the most difficult problem you currently face
3. Force yourself to identify at least three potential values hidden within it
4. Develop concrete actions to extract that value

### Step 4: Blame Elimination

Blame-focused cultures create fear, which leads to information hiding and responsibility avoidance. Eliminating blame creates psychological safety that enables expanded responsibility.

**Exercise: From Blame to Solution Transformation**

1. Identify a recent failure or setback
2. Write down your instinctive blame-oriented thoughts ("This happened because Person X did Y")
3. Transform each blame statement into a system observation ("This happened because our system allows/encourages Z")
4. Create forward-focused learning questions ("How might we adjust our system to prevent this in the future?")

**Example from Deepwater Horizon:**
- Failure: "Misinterpretation of negative pressure test"
- Blame Statement: "The toolpusher didn't properly understand the test results"
- System Observation: "Our system allowed critical tests to be interpreted without clear criteria for success/failure and without multiple independent verifications"
- Learning Question: "How might we redesign our testing protocols to include unambiguous pass/fail criteria and require independent verification of critical safety tests?"

**Example from Fukushima:**
- Failure: "Backup generator flooding"
- Blame Statement: "The engineers who designed the plant didn't account for a tsunami of this magnitude"
- System Observation: "Our system based critical safety parameters on historical data without sufficient margins for extreme but possible events"
- Learning Question: "How might we incorporate more conservative safety margins and defense-in-depth for truly catastrophic scenarios, even those considered highly unlikely?"

**Elimination Strategy:**
1. Ban blame language in post-mortems and reviews (no "should have," "failed to," etc.)
2. Establish a norm of speaking about systems and processes rather than individuals
3. Create a "blame-to-system" translation guide for your team
4. Recognize and reward those who focus on solutions rather than attribution

### Step 5: Ripple Effect Mapping

Limited responsibility often stems from limited awareness of how our decisions impact others. Ripple effect mapping expands that awareness.

**Exercise: Decision Impact Cascade**

For a significant decision you're facing:
1. Identify all direct impacts (first-degree effects)
2. For each direct impact, identify indirect impacts (second-degree effects)
3. For key indirect impacts, identify tertiary impacts (third-degree effects)
4. Review the complete cascade and identify impacts you hadn't previously considered

**Example from Deepwater Horizon:**
- Decision: "Using fewer centralizers than recommended"
- First Degree Impact: "Saves time and money in the short term"
- Second Degree Impact: "Creates potential for poor cement job"
- Third Degree Impact: "Increases risk of hydrocarbon migration and potential blowout"

**Example from Fukushima:**
- Decision: "Maintaining a skeleton crew during crisis"
- First Degree Impact: "Increases risk for remaining workers"
- Second Degree Impact: "Reduces overall radiation exposure across the team"
- Third Degree Impact: "Preserves critical expertise for long-term management"

**Mapping Strategy:**
1. Before making any significant decision, conduct a ripple effect mapping exercise
2. Pay special attention to impacts on stakeholders you don't typically consider
3. Look for unintended consequences, especially negative third-degree effects
4. Adjust decisions based on your expanded awareness of potential impacts

## Application to Case Studies

To demonstrate how the Ownership Expansion Tool works in practice, let's apply it to the contrasting cases from Chapter 7: Masao Yoshida at Fukushima and the BP leadership during the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

### Case Application: Fukushima and Masao Yoshida

#### Responsibility Horizon Mapping

| Core Circle (Direct Control) | Influence Circle (Indirect Control) | System Circle (Broader Accountability) |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Plant operations and procedures | Coordination with TEPCO headquarters | Public safety beyond evacuation zones |
| Safety of plant workers | Communications with government officials | Long-term environmental impact |
| Immediate emergency response | Local evacuation planning | Japan's energy security |
| Internal resource allocation | Equipment procurement from outside | Nuclear industry reputation |
| Moment-to-moment decisions | Media communications | National economic impact |

**Items Moved into Core Circle:**
1. Coordination with TEPCO headquarters (from Influence Circle)
2. Public safety beyond evacuation zones (from System Circle)

Yoshida expanded his responsibility horizon most dramatically when he:
- Took personal ownership of the cooling strategy despite corporate directives
- Considered himself responsible for the safety of all Japanese citizens potentially affected by radiation
- Viewed the plant's long-term environmental impact as his direct responsibility

#### Buck Stops Everywhere Implementation

| Problem | Typical Excuse | Yoshida's Ownership Statement | Action Taken |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Corporate order to stop seawater injection | "I'm required to follow orders from headquarters" | "I am fully responsible for preventing a meltdown, regardless of corporate directives" | Continued seawater injection while appearing to comply |
| Lack of cooling options | "The tsunami destroyed our systems; no one could have prepared for this" | "I am fully responsible for finding cooling solutions, no matter how unconventional" | Authorized fire trucks as improvised cooling systems |
| Dangerous radiation levels | "Regulatory limits require evacuation at these levels" | "I am fully responsible for maintaining critical operations even at personal risk" | Remained on site despite dangerous exposure |
| Conflicting government directives | "I can't be expected to resolve contradictions in official guidance" | "I am fully responsible for making the best decision based on ground conditions" | Made autonomous decisions based on actual conditions |
| Equipment limitations | "We simply don't have the necessary equipment" | "I am fully responsible for finding or creating solutions with whatever is available" | Repurposed available equipment for emergency use |

#### Problem Value Finder

| Problem | Threat Framing | Yoshida's Value Opportunity | Action to Extract Value |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Loss of cooling systems | "We cannot maintain safe temperatures in the reactors" | "This forces us to develop innovative cooling approaches that could help in future disasters" | Improvised sea water cooling using fire trucks |
| High radiation areas | "Critical areas of the plant are inaccessible" | "This compels us to develop remote operating procedures and radiation mapping" | Created new work protocols with rotation schedules and shielding |
| Hydrogen buildup | "Risk of additional explosions in other reactors" | "This highlights a critical design vulnerability that must be addressed industry-wide" | Developed venting strategies and documented lessons for future design |
| Loss of power | "We cannot operate essential monitoring equipment" | "This opportunity to identify truly essential systems can inform future emergency planning" | Prioritized limited battery power for only the most critical functions |
| Communication breakdowns | "We cannot coordinate effectively with outside agencies" | "This reveals gaps in our emergency communication protocols that we can strengthen" | Established alternative communication channels and decision authorities |

#### Blame Elimination

| Failure | Typical Blame Approach | Yoshida's System Observation | Forward-Focused Learning |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Inadequate tsunami protection | "The design engineers underestimated tsunami risk" | "Our risk assessment system relied too heavily on historical data without adequate safety margins" | "How can we design facilities to withstand events beyond historical precedent?" |
| Emergency generator flooding | "Maintenance staff should have better protected equipment" | "Our redundant systems shared common vulnerability points" | "How can we ensure backup systems don't share failure modes?" |
| Hydrogen explosion in Reactor 1 | "The venting procedure was implemented too late" | "Our procedures didn't account for loss of power to vent control systems" | "How can we design passive venting systems that don't require power?" |
| Communication delays with government | "Government officials were too slow to respond" | "Our communication protocols had too many approval layers for crisis situations" | "How can we streamline emergency communications while maintaining necessary oversight?" |
| Radiation exposure to workers | "Workers shouldn't have entered high-radiation areas" | "Our monitoring systems weren't designed for post-accident conditions" | "How can we develop better radiation monitoring for severe accident scenarios?" |

#### Decision Impact Cascade

| Decision | First Degree Impact | Second Degree Impact | Third Degree Impact | Action Based on Analysis |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Continuing seawater injection despite orders | Potential insubordination consequences | Prevented potential meltdown | Protected millions from radiation exposure | Proceeded despite personal risk |
| Maintaining skeleton crew | Increased risk for remaining workers | Reduced overall radiation exposure across team | Preserved critical expertise for long-term management | Selected volunteers with lowest family obligations |
| Requesting conservative evacuation zones | Immediate economic disruption to region | Prevented potential radiation exposure | Built public trust in safety prioritization | Pushed for maximally conservative zones despite economic impact |
| Focusing on Unit 1 stability first | Delayed attention to other units | Established cooling precedents applicable to other units | Created systematic approach for all units | Allocated resources based on comprehensive risk assessment |
| Personal decision to remain on site | Extreme personal radiation exposure | Maintained leadership continuity | Established culture of commitment that inspired team | Accepted personal health risk for mission success |

### Case Application: Deepwater Horizon and BP Leadership

#### Responsibility Horizon Mapping

| Core Circle (Direct Control) | Influence Circle (Indirect Control) | System Circle (Broader Accountability) |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Meeting contractual obligations | Contractor management | Overall well integrity |
| Following company procedures | Addressing observed safety issues | Environmental protection |
| Complying with regulations | Raising concerns about test results | Worker safety across companies |
| Meeting schedule targets | Coordination between contractors | Gulf Coast community impact |
| Budget management | Interpretation of test data | Industry safety standards |

**Items Never Moved into Core Circle:**
BP and contractor leadership consistently maintained narrow responsibility boundaries, keeping critical safety and environmental issues in the Influence or System circles rather than bringing them into their Core responsibility.

#### Buck Stops Everywhere Implementation

| Problem | Actual Excuse Used | Ownership Statement That Was Needed | Action That Should Have Been Taken |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Anomalous pressure test results | "Transocean is responsible for conducting and interpreting tests" | "I am fully responsible for ensuring well integrity regardless of which contractor performs the tests" | Halt operations until test anomalies were fully resolved |
| Cement job concerns | "Halliburton is the cementing expert; they said it would probably be fine" | "I am fully responsible for well integrity, including verification of critical barriers" | Conduct additional cement bond testing before proceeding |
| Fewer centralizers than recommended | "Schedule pressures required expedited completion" | "I am fully responsible for safe well design regardless of schedule pressures" | Install recommended number of centralizers despite delay |
| Blowout preventer maintenance | "The BOP is Transocean's equipment" | "I am fully responsible for ensuring all critical safety equipment is fully functional" | Verify BOP functionality through comprehensive testing |
| Multiple simultaneous operations | "Concurrent activities are standard in the industry" | "I am fully responsible for managing cumulative risk from all operations" | Sequence activities to minimize compounding risks |

#### Problem Value Finder Failure

| Problem | BP's Threat Framing | Value Opportunity Missed | Action That Should Have Been Taken |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Cement test failures | "This will delay our already behind-schedule project" | "This reveals potential well integrity issues before they become catastrophic" | Treat anomalies as valuable warning signs requiring full investigation |
| Budget overruns | "This threatens our financial performance metrics" | "This indicates our planning process needs improvement for future projects" | Analyze root causes of overruns to improve future project planning |
| Schedule delays | "This increases costs and threatens bonuses" | "This reveals overoptimistic scheduling that creates safety pressure" | Recalibrate scheduling practices to include realistic safety margins |
| Staff concerns about procedures | "This represents resistance to efficient operations" | "This highlights potential safety gaps identified by frontline expertise" | Create systematic process to document and address staff safety concerns |
| Equipment limitations | "This creates operational constraints we must work around" | "This identifies equipment design improvements needed for future operations" | Document limitations and invest in improved equipment design |

#### Blame Institutionalization

| Failure | BP's Blame Approach | System Observation Needed | Forward-Focused Learning Needed |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Misinterpretation of negative pressure test | "The Transocean crew didn't properly understand test results" | "Our system allowed critical tests to be interpreted without clear criteria and verification" | "How can we implement unambiguous test protocols with multiple independent verifications?" |
| Inadequate cement job | "Halliburton provided faulty cementing services" | "Our well design and verification system didn't ensure barrier integrity" | "How can we create redundant barrier systems and verification processes?" |
| Failed blowout preventer | "Transocean didn't properly maintain the BOP" | "Our emergency response system relied on a single point of failure" | "How can we implement truly redundant safety systems with independent failure modes?" |
| Delayed response to warning signs | "Individuals failed to recognize and report anomalies" | "Our hazard identification system didn't effectively capture or escalate warning signs" | "How can we create safety systems that don't depend on perfect human performance?" |
| Poor coordination between companies | "Contractors failed to communicate effectively" | "Our multi-contractor management system created organizational gaps" | "How can we design integrated teams that overcome contractual boundaries?" |

#### Ripple Mapping Blindness

| Decision | Direct Impact Considered | Second Degree Impact Ignored | Third Degree Impact Ignored | What Should Have Been Done |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Using fewer centralizers | Saved time and money | Compromised cement job quality | Created potential pathway for gas migration | Conducted comprehensive risk assessment of design changes |
| Proceeding despite test anomalies | Maintained schedule | Missed critical well integrity issues | Left well in unstable condition that led to blowout | Halted operations until anomalies were fully understood |
| Displacing mud before setting surface plug | Saved time in procedure | Removed critical hydrostatic barrier | Eliminated primary blowout prevention mechanism | Maintained multiple barrier philosophy at all times |
| Disabling automatic alarms | Prevented "nuisance" alarms | Reduced warning capacity | Delayed emergency response | Addressed alarm issues without compromising safety system |
| Focusing on schedule over testing | Met short-term deadlines | Missed critical safety verification | Created catastrophic risk to people and environment | Prioritized safety verification regardless of schedule impact |

### Everyday Leadership Application

The Ownership Expansion Tool isn't just for crisis situations. Here's how everyday leaders can apply it:

**For Team Leaders:**
- Use Responsibility Horizon Mapping in team meetings to clarify who owns what
- Practice Buck Stops Everywhere by personally addressing problems that fall between team member responsibilities
- Apply Problem Value Finder to recurring challenges that the team typically avoids
- Implement Blame Elimination in performance reviews by focusing on system improvements
- Use Ripple Effect Mapping when planning changes that affect multiple stakeholders

**For Individual Contributors:**
- Expand your Core Circle to include the success of colleagues, not just your own tasks
- Practice Buck Stops Everywhere when you notice problems outside your formal role
- Use Problem Value Finder to reframe difficult assignments as growth opportunities
- Apply Blame Elimination when giving feedback to peers
- Consider the Ripple Effects of your decisions on other departments and customers

### Crisis Leadership Application

During crises, the Ownership Expansion Tool becomes even more valuable:

1. **Pre-Crisis Preparation:**
   - Conduct Responsibility Horizon Mapping specifically for potential crisis scenarios
   - Identify key stakeholders who would be affected in each scenario
   - Practice Ripple Effect Mapping for worst-case scenarios

2. **During-Crisis Application:**
   - Implement Buck Stops Everywhere by taking ownership of all aspects of the crisis response
   - Use Problem Value Finder to identify opportunities within the crisis
   - Practice Blame Elimination to maintain team cohesion under pressure

3. **Post-Crisis Learning:**
   - Apply Blame-to-Solution Transformation to learn from the crisis without creating a blame culture
   - Conduct a comprehensive Ripple Effect analysis to understand the full impact
   - Expand Responsibility Horizons based on what the crisis revealed

## Reflection Questions

1. In which areas do you most often find yourself saying "That's not my responsibility"?

2. What would change in your organization if everyone adopted a "Buck Stops Everywhere" mindset?

3. How might your leadership change if you viewed every problem as valuable rather than threatening?

4. Where in your organization does blame currently substitute for problem-solving?

5. What third-degree effects of your decisions have you typically overlooked?

6. What's the biggest opportunity currently hiding in your most significant problem?

7. Which aspect of the Ownership Expansion Tool would create the most immediate positive change in your leadership?

## Conclusion: From Responsibility to Leadership Gravity

As we saw in Chapter 7, responsibility operates like gravity. The more authority and capability you have, the stronger your responsibility gravity should be. Things that might reasonably escape the responsibility gravity of someone with less authority should be captured by your stronger gravitational pull.

The Ownership Expansion Tool helps you increase your leadership gravity—your capacity to take ownership of increasingly complex and far-reaching issues. As your responsibility horizon expands, your leadership influence naturally grows with it.

Remember Masao Yoshida at Fukushima: his willingness to expand his responsibility beyond conventional boundaries didn't diminish his authority—it amplified it. In the moments that mattered most, his team followed him not because of his title, but because of his expanded ownership.

True responsibility isn't a burden to be minimized. It's a capability to be developed. The more responsibility you're willing to embrace, the more impact you can have—on your team, your organization, and possibly, like Yoshida, on the world.
