# Tool 8: The Systemic Impact Evaluator

## Purpose
To help leaders assess and maximize their broader impact beyond organizational boundaries. This tool addresses the problem of narrowly focused leadership that ignores societal consequences and opportunities, resulting in short-term gains at the expense of long-term value and societal legitimacy.

## Why the Systemic Impact Evaluator Matters

Most leadership tools focus narrowly on organizational performance, treating the broader social, environmental, and economic context as external factors rather than core leadership responsibilities. This limited perspective creates several critical problems:

1. **Externalized Costs**: Organizations optimize internal metrics while pushing costs onto society, natural systems, and future generations
2. **Value Destruction**: Short-term organizational gains often come at the expense of systemic value that ultimately supports the organization itself
3. **Missed Opportunities**: Leaders fail to recognize how strengthening broader systems can create sustainable competitive advantages
4. **Legitimacy Erosion**: Organizations that extract from rather than contribute to society ultimately lose their social license to operate

The Systemic Impact Evaluator addresses these problems by expanding leaders' perspective beyond organizational boundaries to understand their true impact, both positive and negative. It helps leaders transition from extractive to regenerative citizenship and develop practical strategies for creating positive systemic change.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Impact Mapping - Identify the organization's full societal footprint

Begin by mapping all stakeholders and systems affected by your organization, from those directly connected to those indirectly influenced by your operations, products, or services.

1. **Stakeholder Identification**:
   - List all direct stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, investors)
   - Identify indirect stakeholders (communities, future generations, ecosystems)
   - Map how your organization's activities affect each stakeholder group

2. **Externality Analysis**:
   - Document positive externalities (benefits others receive without paying)
   - Document negative externalities (costs others bear without compensation)
   - Quantify these impacts where possible (financial, social, environmental)

3. **System Mapping**:
   - Identify the key systems your organization operates within (economic, social, environmental)
   - Map how your organization influences these systems
   - Identify feedback loops where system health affects your organization

**Example from Patagonia**:
Patagonia's impact mapping revealed that while its direct environmental footprint was relatively small compared to larger companies, its influence extended to:
- Supply chain workers across multiple countries
- Farming communities in cotton-growing regions
- Ecosystems affected by material extraction and processing
- Public policy related to environmental protection
- Consumer attitudes toward consumption and sustainability

This comprehensive mapping helped the company identify intervention points where it could create positive systemic impact far beyond its size. [1]

### Step 2: Horizon Extension - Shift perspective from quarterly to generational thinking

Most organizations overvalue short-term impacts and undervalue long-term consequences. This step corrects that distortion by explicitly evaluating decisions across multiple time horizons.

1. **Multi-Horizon Impact Assessment**:
   - Evaluate decisions across five time horizons:
     - Immediate (0-1 year)
     - Short-term (1-3 years)
     - Medium-term (3-10 years)
     - Long-term (10-30 years)
     - Legacy (30+ years)
   - Document how impacts might evolve across these timeframes

2. **Future-Back Planning**:
   - Define your desired legacy impact (30+ years)
   - Work backward to identify what must be true at each previous horizon
   - Compare with your current trajectory to identify gaps

3. **Intergenerational Assessment**:
   - Consider impacts on future generations
   - Evaluate whether current actions expand or constrain future options
   - Identify opportunities to create enduring positive legacy

**Example from Unilever**:
Under CEO Paul Polman, Unilever eliminated quarterly earnings guidance and implemented a 10-year Sustainable Living Plan with specific environmental and social targets. This longer time horizon allowed the company to make investments in sustainable agriculture, packaging reduction, and water conservation that might have appeared costly in the short term but created substantial value over time. The approach ultimately delivered stronger financial returns while reducing environmental impact—Unilever's purpose-driven brands grew 69% faster than the rest of the business. [2]

### Step 3: Transparency Assessment - Evaluate the transparency of organizational practices

Transparency is essential for accountability, trust-building, and system health. This step evaluates how visible your organization's impacts are to stakeholders and identifies opportunities to increase transparency.

1. **Disclosure Evaluation**:
   - Assess what information you currently disclose about your impacts
   - Identify gaps between what you know internally and what is publicly available
   - Evaluate the accessibility and understandability of your disclosures

2. **Stakeholder Perspective Analysis**:
   - For each key stakeholder group, assess their ability to see and understand your impacts
   - Identify information asymmetries that disadvantage certain stakeholders
   - Develop strategies to address these gaps

3. **Transparency Strategy Development**:
   - Create a plan for increasing transparency about both positive and negative impacts
   - Identify barriers to greater transparency and strategies to overcome them
   - Establish metrics for evaluating transparency progress

**Example from Interface**:
Carpet manufacturer Interface committed to radical transparency about its environmental impact, publishing detailed metrics on its progress toward sustainability goals. The company didn't just share positive stories but openly disclosed challenges and setbacks. This transparency created accountability that drove continuous improvement and built credibility with stakeholders. Ray Anderson, the company's founder, noted: "If you're not being transparent, you're hiding something—and usually it's something you're ashamed of." [3]

### Step 4: Skin in the Game Measurement - Quantify personal/organizational costs of ethical choices

Real citizenship requires putting something at risk. This step evaluates whether you have sufficient skin in the game to ensure your decisions align with the broader good.

1. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Identify where decision-makers are insulated from the consequences of their decisions
   - Evaluate the alignment between those who benefit from decisions and those who bear costs
   - Quantify the personal and organizational stakes in key decisions

2. **Incentive Alignment Analysis**:
   - Evaluate how compensation and promotion systems align with systemic impact
   - Identify perverse incentives that reward extraction rather than contribution
   - Develop strategies to better align individual incentives with positive systemic impact

3. **Commitment Mechanism Design**:
   - Create structures that increase accountability for systemic impact
   - Develop public commitments that create reputational risk for non-performance
   - Implement governance mechanisms that ensure follow-through

**Example from CVS Health**:
When CVS Health decided to stop selling tobacco products in 2014, the company put significant skin in the game—sacrificing $2 billion in annual revenue that represented approximately 3% of the company's total sales. This decision wasn't just a minor adjustment but a material financial sacrifice based on the recognition that selling tobacco contradicted the company's healthcare mission. This alignment of actions with values, despite short-term costs, created long-term business benefits through enhanced brand trust and new partnership opportunities. [4]

### Step 5: Advocacy Amplification - Examine how organizational influence can drive positive change

Individual organizations often can't solve systemic problems alone. This step helps you leverage your influence to create broader positive change.

1. **Influence Inventory**:
   - Map all avenues of influence your organization possesses (industry relationships, political connections, public platform, etc.)
   - Evaluate how effectively you're currently using this influence for positive change
   - Identify opportunities to more strategically deploy your influence

2. **Coalition Mapping**:
   - Identify potential partners for collective action on key issues
   - Evaluate barriers to effective collaboration
   - Develop strategies to build and strengthen coalitions

3. **Voice Amplification Strategy**:
   - Create a plan for using your organization's voice to advance positive systemic change
   - Identify issues where your organization has unique credibility or standing
   - Develop an approach for balancing advocacy with other organizational priorities

**Example from Patagonia**:
Patagonia has used its platform to advocate for environmental causes far beyond its direct business interests. The company has filed lawsuits to protect public lands, created documentaries about environmental issues, and supported grassroots environmental organizations through its 1% for the Planet commitment. In 2022, the company took its advocacy to an unprecedented level by transferring ownership to a trust and nonprofit dedicated to fighting climate change, ensuring that all profits not reinvested in the business would go to environmental causes.

## Application to Case Studies

### Case Study: Microsoft's Carbon Negative Commitment

In January 2020, Microsoft announced a bold environmental commitment: not just to reduce its carbon footprint or become carbon neutral, but to become carbon negative by 2030. Further, the company committed to removing from the environment by 2050 all the carbon it had emitted since its founding in 1975. Let's examine how Microsoft applied (or could have applied) the Systemic Impact Evaluator to this commitment:

#### Impact Mapping
Microsoft mapped its carbon impact across three scopes:
- Scope 1: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources
- Scope 2: Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling
- Scope 3: All other indirect emissions in the company's value chain

Crucially, Microsoft recognized that Scope 3 emissions—including those from its supply chain, business travel, and even customer use of its products—represented over 75% of its total footprint. This comprehensive mapping led to a more ambitious commitment than if the company had focused only on its direct operations. [6]

#### Horizon Extension
Microsoft's commitment explicitly spans multiple time horizons:
- Short-term: 55% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030
- Medium-term: Carbon negative by 2030
- Long-term: Removal of historical carbon by 2050

This multi-horizon approach allowed Microsoft to set both ambitious long-term goals and concrete near-term targets, creating accountability while acknowledging the scale of the challenge. [7]

#### Transparency Assessment
Microsoft committed to annual reporting on its progress, including:
- Detailed disclosure of emissions across all three scopes
- Third-party verification of carbon accounting
- Transparent methodology for calculating carbon footprint
- Public sharing of challenges and setbacks

This transparency creates accountability that drives action and allows stakeholders to evaluate the company's progress. [8]

#### Skin in the Game
Microsoft put significant skin in the game through:
- $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate carbon reduction technology
- Internal carbon tax applied to all business divisions
- Executive compensation tied to sustainability goals
- Public commitment that creates reputational risk for non-performance

These mechanisms align individual and organizational incentives with the company's climate goals. [9]

#### Advocacy Amplification
Microsoft leveraged its influence through:
- Engaging its vast supplier network to reduce their emissions
- Developing tools and platforms to help other organizations measure and reduce their carbon footprints
- Advocating for public policies that advance climate action
- Participating in industry coalitions to drive broader systemic change

This advocacy extends Microsoft's impact far beyond what it could achieve through direct operations alone. [10]

### Case Study: Wells Fargo Account Fraud Scandal

The Wells Fargo account fraud scandal provides a stark contrast—a case where systemic impact was ignored with devastating consequences. Between 2002 and 2016, Wells Fargo employees created approximately 3.5 million fraudulent accounts without customer consent due to aggressive sales targets and a toxic culture. Let's examine this through the Systemic Impact Evaluator:

#### Impact Mapping Failure
Wells Fargo failed to map its impact on key stakeholders:
- Customers faced unauthorized fees, damaged credit scores, and breach of trust
- Employees experienced extreme pressure, ethical distress, and ultimately job loss (over 5,300 employees were fired)
- Regulators and the financial system suffered damaged credibility
- The banking industry faced increased public distrust

This narrow focus on sales metrics to the exclusion of stakeholder impacts created the conditions for systemic failure. [11]

#### Short-Term Horizon Dominance
Wells Fargo's approach reflected extreme short-term thinking:
- Quarterly sales targets drove behavior at all levels
- Long-term impacts on customer trust were ignored
- Sustainable business practices were sacrificed for immediate growth metrics
- Legacy considerations about institutional reputation were discounted

This short-term orientation created temporary growth at the expense of long-term value, ultimately resulting in billions in fines and incalculable reputation damage. [12]

#### Transparency Avoidance
Wells Fargo actively obscured its practices:
- Leadership ignored or suppressed internal whistleblowers
- External complaints were dismissed or minimized
- Disclosure of sales practices was limited and misleading
- The scale of the problem was hidden from regulators and the public

This lack of transparency allowed the fraudulent practices to continue for years, magnifying the eventual damage. [13]

#### Skin in the Game Misalignment
Wells Fargo's incentive structure created severe misalignment:
- Frontline employees faced termination if they didn't meet sales targets
- Executives received bonuses based on growth numbers achieved through fraudulent means
- Those making decisions about sales targets were insulated from customer interactions
- Consequences primarily fell on lower-level employees rather than senior leadership

This misalignment created a system where unethical behavior was practically inevitable. [14]

#### Advocacy Failure
Wells Fargo used its influence to:
- Lobby against stronger consumer protection regulations
- Minimize the severity of the scandal when it became public
- Resist systemic changes to banking practices
- Deflect accountability by blaming "rogue employees"

This advocacy orientation prioritized organizational protection over system health, ultimately damaging both. [15]

## Everyday Leadership Application

The Systemic Impact Evaluator isn't just for major corporate initiatives or crises. Here's how leaders can apply it in everyday contexts:

### For Team Leaders
- **Impact Mapping**: Regularly discuss how team decisions affect other departments, customers, and community stakeholders
- **Horizon Extension**: Include 5+ year impacts in decision criteria, not just quarterly or annual results
- **Transparency**: Share team challenges and failures with the broader organization to enable learning
- **Skin in the Game**: Ensure team incentives align with positive impact, not just output metrics
- **Advocacy**: Use team expertise to improve organizational systems, not just optimize within them

### For Division Leaders
- **Impact Mapping**: Consider supply chain, community, and environmental impacts in strategic planning
- **Horizon Extension**: Develop division strategy with explicit 10+ year horizon considerations
- **Transparency**: Create mechanisms for stakeholders to see and understand division operations and impacts
- **Skin in the Game**: Tie leadership compensation to long-term division health, not just short-term metrics
- **Advocacy**: Champion industry-wide improvements that might not directly benefit your division

### For C-Suite Executives
- **Impact Mapping**: Regularly assess organization-wide systemic footprint across all stakeholders
- **Horizon Extension**: Establish 25+ year legacy vision alongside quarterly targets
- **Transparency**: Create a culture that rewards surfacing problems and acknowledging limitations
- **Skin in the Game**: Ensure personal financial outcomes are tied to long-term organizational and societal health
- **Advocacy**: Use organizational platform to address systemic issues beyond immediate business interests

### For Board Members
- **Impact Mapping**: Require comprehensive stakeholder impact assessments for major decisions
- **Horizon Extension**: Evaluate CEO performance on long-term value creation, not just quarterly results
- **Transparency**: Champion robust disclosure practices beyond minimum requirements
- **Skin in the Game**: Structure governance to ensure adequate consideration of all stakeholder interests
- **Advocacy**: Support collective action on industry-wide challenges even when immediate ROI isn't clear

## Integration with Other Ethical Tools

The Systemic Impact Evaluator works best when integrated with other tools from the Broken Compass framework:

### Connection to the Non-Negotiable Audit
The Non-Negotiable Audit helps identify your absolute ethical boundaries—the lines you will not cross regardless of circumstances. These non-negotiables provide essential guardrails for systemic impact assessment.

**Integration Point**: Use your established non-negotiables as a filter for evaluating potential impacts. Any action that would violate a non-negotiable is automatically disqualified, regardless of other potential benefits.

### Connection to the Core-Periphery Audit
The Core-Periphery Audit distinguishes between core principles that must remain fixed and peripheral expressions that can adapt to different contexts. This distinction guides how you apply your values across diverse systems.

**Integration Point**: Apply core principles consistently across all impact areas while allowing flexible application based on specific context. This balance enables both principled action and contextual wisdom.

### Connection to the Trust Equation Audit
The Trust Equation Audit helps build comprehensive trust across dimensions of credibility, reliability, intimacy, and self-orientation. Strong trust relationships are essential for effective systemic impact.

**Integration Point**: Use trust-building practices to engage stakeholders in your impact assessment and improvement efforts. Without trust, even well-intentioned impact initiatives may face resistance or skepticism.

### Connection to the Ethical Decision Matrix
The Ethical Decision Matrix evaluates decisions across dimensions of time horizon, stakeholder impact, value alignment, and institutional effect. These dimensions directly inform systemic impact assessment.

**Integration Point**: Use the Ethical Decision Matrix to evaluate specific decisions within your broader systemic impact strategy. This ensures coherence between individual choices and systemic goals.

## Reflection Questions

1. How would your organization's decision-making change if you had to account for impacts over the next 100 years, not just the next quarter?

2. What negative externalities (costs borne by others) does your organization currently create but not acknowledge or address?

3. Who are the stakeholders most affected by your operations but least consulted in your decisions?

4. If your organization disappeared tomorrow, what systems would be strengthened? What systems would be weakened?

5. Where do you have unique capability to influence positive systemic change beyond your organizational boundaries?

6. How aligned are the incentives of decision-makers with the long-term health of the systems your organization depends on?

7. What information about your impacts do you know internally but don't disclose externally? Why?

8. How might your definition of success change if you prioritized systemic health over organizational growth?

## Conclusion: From Organization-Centric to System-Aware Leadership

The Systemic Impact Evaluator represents a fundamental shift in leadership perspective—from viewing organizations as discrete entities pursuing narrow self-interest to seeing them as nodes in interconnected systems with responsibilities for system health.

This shift isn't just ethically important; it's strategically essential. In an increasingly complex, interconnected world, organizations that extract value from systems without contributing to their health ultimately undermine the foundations of their own success. The most sustainable competitive advantages come from strengthening the systems that support all participants.

By systematically mapping your impact, extending your time horizons, increasing transparency, ensuring you have skin in the game, and amplifying your advocacy, you can transform your leadership from organization-centric to system-aware. This transformation doesn't just benefit society—it creates organizations that are more resilient, innovative, and capable of creating enduring value.

The choice is clear: You can be a system taker, passively accepting and exploiting the systems you find; a system breaker, extracting maximum short-term value regardless of systemic damage; or a system maker, actively contributing to health and resilience of the systems that make your success possible. The Systemic Impact Evaluator helps you become the latter—a leader who creates value not just for your organization but for the entire system you're part of.
