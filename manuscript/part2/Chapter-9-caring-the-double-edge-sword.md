# Caring: The Double-Edged Sword of Leadership

Think being a caring leader means always being nice and supportive? Think again. You're not running a daycare; you're leading an organization. True caring is about as comfortable as a bed of nails, and twice as effective.

## The Caring Conundrum

Here's a truth bomb for you: The more you try to be seen as a "caring" leader, the less effective your care becomes. Why? Because real care isn't about making people feel good; it's about making them be better.

When Mining Minister Laurence Golborne arrived at the San José mine in Chile after 33 miners were trapped 2,300 feet underground, he faced an excruciating dilemma: Should he offer families hope that their loved ones might still be alive? Or should he prepare them for the more likely outcome—that their fathers, husbands, and sons were already dead? [1]

What would you have done? Many leaders would have chosen the path of comfort—offering reassuring platitudes to ease immediate pain. Instead, Golborne took a different approach: "I cannot promise that we will find them alive," he told the families. "What I can promise is that we will do everything humanly possible to find them." [2]

This balance of brutal honesty with unwavering commitment exemplifies true caring leadership—one that refuses to confuse temporary comfort with genuine compassion.

## The Coddling Catastrophe

Let's dissect how most "leaders" handle caring:

1. **The Conflict Avoider**: "I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings." Translation: "I'm too weak to have difficult conversations."

Consider Amazon, where managers are explicitly instructed to "Address the performance issue first, then you can care about their problems." While this might sound harsh, it recognizes a fundamental truth: ignoring performance issues doesn't help anyone. Yet Amazon's implementation fails by making caring conditional on performance, creating a system where those who most need support are least likely to receive it. [3]

2. **The Praise Dispenser**: "Everyone's doing great!" Great, you've just made excellence meaningless.

During the Chilean mining rescue, psychologists monitoring communications between trapped miners and their families made difficult decisions to withhold some family letters that might increase miners' anxiety. This wasn't uncaring; it was recognizing that indiscriminate "positivity" can sometimes do more harm than good when people face life-threatening challenges. [4]

3. **The Work-Life Balance Preacher**: "Don't check emails after 6 PM!" Meanwhile, the competition is eating your lunch at 10 PM.

Amazon's "always on" culture represents the opposite extreme—a system where caring about work-life balance is virtually non-existent. With warehouse productivity tracking that doesn't even allow adequate time for bathroom breaks and white-collar expectations of constant availability, Amazon has created a fundamentally uncaring environment that treats humans as expendable resources. [5]

4. **The Emotional Crutch**: "Let me solve all your problems." Congratulations, you've just created a team of helpless dependents.

When the Chilean miners were finally located alive after 17 days, doctors and psychologists didn't immediately grant all their requests for comfort foods and unrestricted family communication. Instead, they established structured protocols that sometimes felt restrictive but were essential for the miners' long-term welfare. This wasn't cruelty—it was care sophisticated enough to prioritize welfare over momentary comfort. [6]

If any of these sound like you, congratulations. You're not caring; you're crippling.

## The Science of Tough Love

Before you dismiss this as mere provocation, let's look at the science. A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that individuals who received negative feedback framed as high standards with assurances about their ability to meet them showed more motivation and performance improvement than those who received unconditional praise. [7]

In other words, setting high expectations and pushing people to meet them isn't mean—it's effective care backed by science.

This explains why Dr. Jorge Díaz, who helped design nutritional protocols for the Chilean miners, insisted on strict dietary control despite the miners' desperate hunger and families who wanted to send down home-cooked meals. "The most caring thing we could do was say no to many requests," he explained. "After 17 days of starvation, unrestricted eating could have killed them. Real caring meant disappointing them in the short term to keep them alive for the long term." [8]

## The Antifragile Approach to Caring

Real caring is tough love on steroids. Here's what it actually looks like:

1. **Brutal Honesty**: If someone's underperforming, tell them. Clearly. It's not kind to let someone fail slowly.

Consider Amazon's leadership, which had data showing their warehouse injury rates were nearly double the industry average—with direct correlations between productivity demands and worker injuries. True caring would mean addressing this reality head-on, not hiding behind safety programs that focus on individual behaviors while ignoring the systemic pace of work causing the injuries. [9]

2. **High Expectations**: Push people beyond their comfort zones. Comfort is the enemy of growth.

During the Chilean rescue, psychologists established an increasingly structured daily regimen for the miners that included mandatory exercise, assigned work duties, and required participation in counseling sessions. When some miners resisted these structures, preferring to cope in their own ways, the response wasn't accommodation but firm maintenance of protocols. This represented understanding that genuine care sometimes means imposing beneficial structure rather than permitting harmful freedom. [10]

3. **Calculated Discomfort**: Create challenges that make your team struggle. That's where real growth and resilience are born.

As one Chilean miner, Víctor Zamora, later said: "Sometimes we hated the exercise requirements and the work assignments. We wanted to be left alone in our misery. But looking back, those structures kept us physically and mentally alive. It was caring that looked like control." [11]

4. **Emotional Intelligence, Not Emotional Coddling**: Understand emotions, don't pander to them. Use that understanding to push people forward, not to pat them on the back.

Amazon's approach represents the opposite extreme—algorithmic management that removes human judgment entirely from caring interactions. As organizational psychologist Amy Edmondson observed: "What Amazon has created is a system where caring is outsourced to algorithms and policies, removing the human judgment that is essential to genuine care." [12]

## The Caring Paradox

Here's where it gets interesting: True caring often looks like its opposite. Let's break it down:

1. **Firing Fast**: The most caring thing you can do for an underperformer is to fire them quickly. You're not doing them any favors by keeping them in a role they're not suited for. You're stunting their growth and poisoning your team.

Amazon gets this half right—they're quick to terminate underperformers. But they miss the other half of the caring equation: they've designed a system that virtually ensures high turnover, with internal documents suggesting automatically terminating workers after three years because "the company's data suggested that most employees became less engaged and less efficient over time." [13]

This isn't caring; it's exploitation masquerading as high standards. Genuine caring combines high expectations with sustainable pathways to meet them.

2. **Embracing Conflict**: A team that never argues is a team that never innovates. Foster healthy conflict. It's not comfortable, but it's caring. It shows you value ideas over egos.

Minister Golborne demonstrated this during the Chilean rescue by maintaining transparency about technical challenges and setbacks, creating an environment where experts could openly disagree about approaches without fear of undermining the overall mission. This conflict-embracing leadership allowed for rapid innovation in drilling techniques that ultimately saved lives. [14]

3. **Letting People Fail**: The most valuable lessons come from failure. If you're always swooping in to save the day, you're robbing your team of growth opportunities. Let them fall. Then teach them how to get back up.

Consider the stark contrast between Amazon's approach to failure—where even minor productivity dips can lead to termination without meaningful coaching—and Golborne's leadership during the mine rescue, where failed drilling attempts were treated as valuable learning opportunities that informed subsequent approaches. [15]

4. **Saying No**: Caring leaders say no more than they say yes. No to mediocre ideas. No to comfort zone projects. No to anything that doesn't push the team or the organization forward.

When psychologists monitoring the Chilean miners' communications made the difficult decision to withhold some family messages that might increase anxiety, they weren't being cruel—they were making tough caring decisions that prioritized long-term psychological welfare over short-term emotional comfort. [16]

## The Empathy Trap

Now, I can hear the objections already. "But what about empathy? Isn't that a crucial part of caring?"

Yes, empathy is crucial. But here's the kicker: Most leaders use empathy as an excuse for inaction. They feel bad about their team's struggles, so they lower the bar. That's not empathy; that's pity. And pity has no place in leadership.

Real empathy in leadership means:

1. Understanding the struggle, but not removing it.
2. Acknowledging the pain, but not alleviating it at the cost of growth.
3. Feeling the fear, but pushing through it anyway—and showing your team how to do the same.

Consider the contrast between Amazon's approach to empathy—where area manager David Seltz found that "When team members came to me with legitimate problems, I had very little discretion to actually help them. The system dictated my response more than my judgment did" [17]—and Golborne's approach during the mine rescue, where he personally delivered difficult news about timeline estimations to families, directly absorbing their grief and anger rather than delegating this painful task. [18]

One strips away human judgment from caring; the other demonstrates that caring sometimes means personally bearing others' pain rather than avoiding it.

## Real-World Example: The Caring Tyrant

Let me tell you about Sarah, a CEO I once worked with. Her team called her "The Caring Tyrant" behind her back. Why? Because she cared enough to be tyrannical about excellence.

When a project failed, she'd gather the team and ask, "How are we going to fail better next time?" She celebrated failures as learning opportunities. But mediocrity? That was unforgivable.

One day, her star performer, Tom, came to her with a "safe" proposal for a new product. Sarah tore it apart. "This isn't you, Tom," she said. "This is you playing not to lose. I expect you to play to win. Try again."

Tom was furious. He thought Sarah didn't appreciate him. A month later, he came back with an idea that revolutionized the company.

That's caring leadership. It's not about making people feel good. It's about making them be great.

Now contrast this with Laurence Golborne's leadership during the Chilean mining crisis. When faced with the technically daunting task of drilling an escape tunnel to reach 33 trapped miners, Golborne implemented a systematic, three-pronged approach with multiple simultaneous rescue plans. When some experts argued that continuing the expensive rescue operation was futile after nearly two weeks with no contact, he pushed forward—not from blind optimism but from a commitment to exhaust every possibility before abandoning hope. [19]

This wasn't being a "tyrant"; it was refusing to acquiesce to comfortable resignation when difficult paths remained unexplored. It was caring enough to persist when easier options were available.

At the other extreme, consider Amazon's mechanized approach to caring. The company maintains programs with caring-themed names like "WorkingWell" and "Connections," but investigations reveal these function more as public relations tools than genuine caring initiatives. The "WorkingWell" program focuses primarily on having workers perform stretches before shifts rather than addressing the fundamental pace of work causing injuries. [20]

This is the illusion of caring—surface-level gestures that don't address root causes of harm. It's caring theater, not caring leadership.

## The Caring Equation

Caring = (Challenge × Support) / Comfort

If your care isn't making someone uncomfortable, it's not real care. It's just pampering.

When Amazon temporarily suspended its productivity tracking during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, injury rates dropped by 33% across affected facilities. When tracking resumed, injury rates promptly returned to previous levels. [21] This natural experiment reveals a fundamental caring failure: the company's standard expectations exceed sustainable human capacity. That's not challenge; it's harmful exploitation.

In contrast, during the Chilean mine rescue, psychologists and doctors designed recovery protocols that pushed miners to maintain physical capability through mandatory exercise while also providing comprehensive psychological support. This wasn't comfortable—one miner reported that they "sometimes hated the exercise requirements and the work assignments." But this balanced approach of high expectations with robust support ultimately preserved both physical and mental health during an unimaginably challenging ordeal. [22]

## The EQ Angle

Let's bring our old friend Emotional Intelligence into the caring game:

- **Self-Awareness**: Recognize when your "care" is actually fear of conflict or desire for approval.

Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos once wrote that "Our culture is friendly and intense, but if push comes to shove we'll settle for intense." [23] This represents at least a self-aware acknowledgment that the company prioritizes performance over comfort—though it fails to recognize that intensity without sustainability eventually becomes destructive rather than developmental.

- **Self-Regulation**: Control your impulse to make everything nice and comfortable.

When Minister Golborne received a realistic timeline for the Chilean rescue—3-4 months to reach the miners—he didn't soften this devastating news when communicating with families. Instead, he directly shared this difficult reality while reaffirming absolute commitment to the effort. This ability to deliver harsh truths without sugarcoating represents crucial emotional self-regulation. [24]

- **Motivation**: Be driven by long-term growth, not short-term happiness.

Amazon's motivation system focuses almost exclusively on short-term productivity metrics, with internal documents revealing discussions of tradeoffs between injury rates and productivity in purely financial terms: "A 10% reduction in rate expectations would likely reduce reported injuries by approximately 15%, but would cost approximately $300M annually in reduced throughput." [25] This calculation fundamentally misconceives caring as a cost center rather than an investment in sustainable human performance.

- **Empathy**: Use it to understand where people need to grow, not where they need to be coddled.

The rescue team in Chile demonstrated sophisticated empathy by developing a personalized extraction plan for each miner, with specific protocols based on their unique physical conditions, psychological profiles, and family situations. This individualized approach represented the antithesis of bureaucratic, standardized care. [26]

- **Social Skills**: Use them to deliver tough messages effectively, not to avoid delivering them at all.

Amazon's system of algorithmic management removes human judgment from caring interactions, with one former manager reporting: "When team members came to me with legitimate problems, I had very little discretion to actually help them. The system dictated my response more than my judgment did." [27] This automation of caring interactions fundamentally undermines the social dimension of leadership.

## The Fine Line: Care vs. Cruelty

Now, let's address the elephant in the room. There's a fine line between tough love and outright cruelty. Here's how to walk that line:

1. **Intention Matters**: Your tough actions should always come from a place of genuine care for the person's growth and the organization's mission. If you're acting tough out of frustration, anger, or ego, you've crossed the line.

Amazon crosses this line when it designs systems that treat workers as disposable inputs rather than developing them as appreciating assets. Former Amazon executive David Niekerk revealed the company's philosophy: "We recognized fairly early on that the nature of our work would lead to high attrition. We built our systems with that expectation." [28] This represents an intentional design for disposability rather than development—cruelty masquerading as efficiency.

2. **Provide Context**: When you're pushing someone hard, make sure they understand why. The challenge itself might be uncomfortable, but the reason behind it should be clear and motivating.

During the Chilean rescue, Minister Golborne adopted a three-part communication framework: acknowledge specific setbacks honestly, explain the technical response being implemented, and place the setback in the larger context of the overall rescue effort. [29] This approach provided crucial context that helped miners and families understand why difficult protocols were necessary.

3. **Be Consistent**: If you're tough on someone one day and coddle them the next, you're not being caring; you're being confusing. Consistency in your high expectations is key.

Amazon demonstrates the opposite of consistency in its caring approach. While claiming that "the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees is our top priority," [30] the company maintains productivity targets that internal data shows directly correlate with injury rates. This contradiction between stated values and operational reality creates what psychologists call "cognitive dissonance" for workers—the psychological stress that comes from being told one thing while experiencing another. [31]

4. **Offer Support**: Throwing someone in the deep end isn't caring; it's drowning them. Offer support, resources, and guidance alongside your challenges.

During the Chilean mining crisis, the rescue team didn't just impose demanding protocols on the trapped miners; they provided comprehensive psychological and medical support to help them meet these challenges. This included regular counseling sessions, carefully designed nutritional programs, and structured communication with families. [32]

5. **Recognize Progress**: When someone meets your high bar, recognize it. This isn't about constant praise, but about acknowledging real achievement.

Amazon's algorithm-driven performance management focuses almost exclusively on identifying deficiencies rather than recognizing growth. One worker described it as: "You're not a person in there. You're a function. And if you can't perform that function at the level they demand, they'll find someone who will. There's no room for having a bad day or slowing down because you're in pain. The algorithm doesn't care." [33]

## The Antifragile Caring Challenge

Ready to stop being a care bear and start being a true leader? Try these:

1. **The Discomfort Directive**: Identify the most uncomfortable truth about each team member's performance. Tell it to them. Today.

The Chilean rescue team didn't hesitate to tell each miner exactly what they needed to do to survive—even when those instructions contradicted the miners' own preferences. When miners resisted the structured daily regimen, psychologists didn't back down but rather explained why these protocols were essential for survival. [34]

2. **The Growth Gauntlet**: Set a goal for each team member that they think is impossible. Make it their top priority.

When the Washington Post documented an "experiment" at Amazon's warehouse in Coffeyville, Kansas, manager William Hough was allowed to reduce rate expectations by 15% and implement worker-led problem-solving teams. The result: productivity initially dipped but then rose to exceed previous levels, while injuries decreased by 24% and turnover dropped by 19%. [35] This demonstrates that challenging goals paired with supportive systems can create sustainable growth rather than exploitation.

3. **The Conflict Creation**: Find an issue your team has been avoiding. Force it into the open. Facilitate a heated debate about it.

Minister Golborne assembled a diverse team of experts from Chile's state-owned copper mining company, the Chilean Navy, NASA, and drilling specialists from around the world. Rather than seeking artificial consensus, he created a decision-making environment where different perspectives could openly clash in service of finding the best rescue approach. [36]

4. **The Failure Festival**: Celebrate your biggest failures. Publicly. Analyze what went wrong and how you'll fail better next time.

Amazon's approach to failure is the opposite of celebration—it's punishment. The company's aggressive productivity tracking leads to termination of approximately 10% of its workforce annually for productivity reasons alone. [37] This creates a culture of fear rather than learning, where failures are hidden rather than examined for growth opportunities.

5. **The Care Calibration**: Ask your team to rate how much you care about them. If you get all 10s, you're doing it wrong. Aim for 7s—high enough to know you care, low enough to know you're pushing them.

After the Chilean miners were rescued, one reflected: "What they did wasn't always what we wanted in the moment. Sometimes it felt controlling or unnecessarily strict. But looking back, I understand now—they cared enough to do what was needed, not just what felt good." [38]

## The Caring Leader's Manifesto

1. I care enough to be honest, even when it hurts.
2. I care enough to set standards that seem unreasonable.
3. I care enough to let you fail, so you can learn to succeed.
4. I care enough to be disliked today, so you can be successful tomorrow.
5. I care enough to put the organization's mission above any individual's comfort.

## The Long-Term View

Here's the ultimate test of your caring leadership: What happens when people leave your team? If they're leaving stronger, more resilient, and more capable than when they arrived, you've cared effectively. If they're leaving comfortable but stagnant, you've failed them, no matter how nice you've been.

Amazon's employee turnover rate—a staggering 150% annually for warehouse workers before the pandemic—tells its own story of caring failure. The company replaces its entire warehouse workforce approximately every eight months, creating what economists call a "local labor market externality"—essentially using up and discarding the available workforce at a pace that affects other employers and strains local social services. [39]

In contrast, the Chilean mining rescue's legacy includes not just the successful extraction of 33 men but their transition back to normal life. The rescue team developed a comprehensive transition program that included immediate medical assessment, financial management support, media training, family reintegration counseling, long-term psychological support, and assistance with career transitions. [40] This forward-looking care reflected an understanding that genuine compassion extends beyond the immediate crisis to long-term wellbeing.

Remember: Caring isn't about being nice. It's about being effective. It's about creating resilient, capable individuals who can thrive with or without you.

Are you ready to stop babysitting and start truly leading? The choice is yours. But choose quickly – the world doesn't reward leaders who confuse caring with coddling.

## From Principle to Practice

True caring requires balancing support with challenge to promote growth. In Part 5 of this book, you'll find the Tough Love Calibrator – a structured approach to caring leadership that avoids both coddling and harshness. This tool helps you identify when comfort becomes counterproductive and develop strategies for challenging others in ways that demonstrate genuine care.

The Tough Love Calibrator guides you through analyzing your comfort zones, calibrating expectations to individuals' capacities, designing productive challenges, formulating growth-oriented feedback, and evaluating the effectiveness of your care approach. By systematically applying this framework to your leadership challenges, you can transform how you and your organization approach caring—moving from superficial niceness to genuine development that balances compassion with necessary challenge.

When you're ready to put tough love into practice, the Tough Love Calibrator will help you translate this principle into everyday leadership actions.

## Reflection Questions

1. Think of a time when someone's "care" for you actually held you back. How could they have cared more effectively?

2. What's the toughest feedback you've been avoiding giving? How is your avoidance a failure of care?

3. How can you restructure your team's challenges to build antifragility?

4. In what ways might your caring be creating learned helplessness in your team?

5. How would your leadership change if you optimized for your team's long-term growth rather than their short-term comfort?

The path of true caring in leadership is steep, rocky, and often lonely. But it's the only path that leads to real growth, both for you and your team. Are you caring enough to take it?
