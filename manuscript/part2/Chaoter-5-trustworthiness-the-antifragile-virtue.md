# Chapter 5: Trustworthiness - The Antifragile Virtue

Consider this paradox: The more you obsess over your trustworthy reputation, the more fragile that reputation becomes. Welcome to the counterintuitive world of ethical leadership.

## The Reputation Trap

You, eager leader, think you're building trust by carefully manicuring your image. You're wrong. Dead wrong. With every calculated move to appear trustworthy, you're constructing a house of cards, not a fortress of integrity.

Why? Because you're playing defense, not offense. You're trying not to lose trust instead of genuinely embodying trustworthiness. It's a sucker's game, and you're the sucker.

When Boeing executives faced the crisis of competing with Airbus's fuel-efficient A320neo, they didn't set out to create a death trap. They set out to protect Boeing's market share, maintain their competitive position, and meet their quarterly targets. Yet in prioritizing reputation management over fundamental engineering integrity, they set in motion a catastrophic trust collapse that cost 346 lives, billions in market value, and incalculable damage to a century-old corporate legacy. [1]

As a former Boeing engineer later reflected: "We knew there were shortcuts being taken. We knew there were pressures to certify quickly. But there's a cognitive dissonance that sets in—you tell yourself it's probably still safe enough, that the risks are theoretical, that the pilots will figure it out if something goes wrong. You convince yourself because the alternative is too uncomfortable to face." [2]

Compare this with Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger in the moments after both engines failed on US Airways Flight 1549. He wasn't thinking about how his decisions would look to others or how to protect his reputation. His focus was entirely on the foundational responsibility: landing the aircraft in a way that gave his passengers the best chance of survival. [3]

The difference isn't just one of character but of fundamental orientation. Boeing leaders were trapped in reputation management; Sullenberger was engaged in responsibility fulfillment. The former creates brittle trust that shatters under pressure; the latter builds antifragile trustworthiness that actually strengthens when tested.

## The Taleb Twist

Nassim Taleb, in his book "Antifragile," drops a truth bomb: the more success you have, the more fragile you become. There's more to lose, more reason to fret, more incentive to compromise. It's a trap, and most leaders waltz right into it.

Here's the kicker: True trustworthiness thrives on volatility, stress, and disorder. It's antifragile. The more it's tested, the stronger it becomes.

Think about it this way: If you've never been tested, how do you know you're trustworthy? It's like claiming to be a great athlete without ever competing. True trustworthiness isn't proven in comfort; it's forged in fire.

Captain Sullenberger wasn't considered extraordinarily trustworthy before Flight 1549. He was simply a competent, experienced pilot doing his job. It was the crucible of crisis—208 seconds of impossible pressure—that revealed the depth of his trustworthiness. As he later reflected: "For 42 years, I've been making small, regular deposits in this bank of experience, education and training. And on January 15, the balance was sufficient so that I could make a very large withdrawal." [4]

This is the essence of antifragile trustworthiness—not a superficial characteristic you project, but a deep capacity you develop through consistent investment that reveals itself precisely when everything is falling apart.

## The Debt of Reputation

Taleb points out: When you're debt-free, you don't give a damn about your financial reputation. It's only when you're leveraged to the eyeballs that you start sweating about what the economic circles think of you.

Translate this to trustworthiness: It's only when you're morally "indebted"—when you've compromised, when you have skeletons in the closet—that you become obsessed with appearing trustworthy. The irony? This very obsession makes you less trustworthy.

Boeing's moral debt accumulated gradually. Each decision to prioritize schedule over safety, each choice to withhold critical information from pilots and regulators, each dismissal of engineer concerns added to the moral leverage. By the time the first 737 MAX crashed, the company was so morally indebted that its immediate response was to blame the pilots rather than confront its own responsibility. [5]

Moral debt doesn't just distort your trustworthiness; it creates perverse incentives that further undermine it. When you're morally leveraged, you become more concerned with avoiding exposure than addressing fundamental issues. You invest in appearances rather than reality. You focus on managing narrative rather than solving problems.

The result is a deadly cycle: Moral debt leads to trust-eroding decisions, which create more moral debt, which leads to more trust-eroding decisions. Unless this cycle is broken through radical responsibility-taking, it eventually collapses under its own weight—usually at the worst possible moment.

## The Antifragile Trust Strategy

So what's the alternative? Here's your antifragile trust strategy:

1. **Embrace Trust Volatility**: Stop avoiding difficult situations. Seek them out. Each ethical challenge is an opportunity to strengthen your trustworthiness, not a threat to it.

Captain Sullenberger didn't just log flight hours; he deliberately pursued opportunities to expand his capabilities. He became an accident investigator for the Air Line Pilots Association. He studied the psychology of error management and crisis decision-making. He published scholarly articles on safety procedures. When the crisis came, these investments paid dividends. [6]

2. **Be Financially and Morally Unleveraged**: Minimize your dependencies. The less you "owe"—financially or ethically—the freer you are to make trustworthy decisions without fear.

Warren Buffett captures this principle perfectly: "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently." [7] By maintaining minimal moral leverage—keeping your word, avoiding shortcuts, addressing problems directly—you create the freedom to act with integrity even when it's temporarily painful.

3. **Love the Randomness**: Unpredictable situations are your allies. They're the ethical equivalent of high-intensity interval training. Embrace them.

The most trustworthy leaders don't dodge complexity or volatility—they welcome it as the testing ground for their principles. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, notes: "Pain plus reflection equals progress." [8] This is especially true for trustworthiness development. The random, unexpected ethical challenges that arise in business become the very mechanism through which your trustworthiness becomes antifragile.

4. **Skin in the Game**: Put yourself at risk. Make decisions where you bear the cost of being wrong. It's the only way to earn genuine trust.

Boeing executives maintained distance from the consequences of their decisions. While they made choices that prioritized schedule and cost over safety, they weren't the ones flying on the planes or bearing direct responsibility if something went wrong. [9] This lack of skin in the game is a trust killer. In contrast, Sullenberger put himself at maximum risk—being the last person to leave Flight 1549 after it had settled on the Hudson, physically searching the aircraft twice to ensure no passengers remained while water filled the cabin. [10]

5. **Via Negativa**: Sometimes, trustworthiness is more about what you don't do than what you do. Eliminate untrustworthy behaviors rather than adding trustworthy ones.

Boeing had a choice after the Lion Air crash: ground the fleet immediately until the cause was fully understood, or continue flying while developing fixes. They chose the latter, with catastrophic consequences for Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. [11] Some of the most trust-building decisions are the ones that eliminate potential harm, even at significant cost.

## The Optionality of Trust

Here's a mind-bender for you: The most trustworthy person is the one who doesn't need to be trusted. They have options. They're not dependent on others' perception of their trustworthiness.

Think about it. Who do you trust more: The person desperately trying to convince you of their honesty, or the person who's indifferent to your opinion of them because they know they're acting with integrity?

This independence creates a paradox: Those who need trust the least earn it the most. When you have the financial, moral, and psychological freedom to walk away from situations that would compromise your integrity, you create the conditions for genuine trustworthiness.

During congressional testimony after the 737 MAX crashes, Boeing representatives appeared desperately concerned with restoring trust—repeatedly emphasizing their commitment to safety and promising process improvements. [12] In contrast, when Captain Sullenberger testified about aviation safety issues, he spoke with the quiet authority of someone unconcerned with managing perception, focused instead on substantive improvement. [13]

The difference is palpable: One is trying to appear trustworthy; the other is simply being trustworthy. And everyone in the room can feel the distinction.

## The Four Dimensions of Trustworthiness

Let's make this concrete. Trustworthiness consists of four key dimensions, beautifully captured in the Trust Equation developed by David Maister: Trustworthiness = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation. [14]

### 1. Credibility: "I can believe what you say"

Credibility is the alignment between your words and reality—both external reality (factual accuracy) and internal reality (your actual beliefs). It requires both competence in your domain and candor in your communication.

Boeing's credibility collapsed when investigations revealed they had deliberately downplayed the significance of the MCAS system to pilots and regulators. Internal documents showed Boeing employees knew more than they disclosed, creating a fatal gap between what the company said and what its people knew to be true. [15]

In contrast, Sullenberger's communication during the crisis was a masterclass in credibility. When air traffic control offered runway options at LaGuardia and Teterboro, he didn't pretend these were viable or hesitate to deliver difficult truths. His simple "We're going to be in the Hudson" communicated the reality of the situation with perfect clarity. [16]

Credibility isn't about being perfect or omniscient. It's about being honest about what you know, what you don't know, and what you believe based on available information.

### 2. Reliability: "I can depend on your consistent actions"

Reliability is consistency over time. It's the alignment between your words and your actions, and between your past and present behavior. Reliability creates predictability, which is essential for others to make decisions that depend on your behavior.

Boeing's reliability collapsed when they departed from their historical emphasis on engineering excellence and safety redundancy. The decision to make MCAS dependent on a single sensor broke with decades of design philosophy that had prioritized redundant systems. [17]

Sullenberger, in contrast, demonstrated remarkable consistency between his long-articulated safety principles and his actions during the crisis. His methodical evacuation of the aircraft, including walking the aisle twice to ensure no passengers remained, showed absolute consistency with his career-long safety prioritization. [18]

Reliability doesn't mean rigidity. It means alignment between your principles and actions, even as circumstances change. The principles remain constant; the specific applications adapt to context.

### 3. Intimacy: "I can safely share concerns with you"

Intimacy in trustworthiness is the safety others feel in being vulnerable with you. It's the confidence that you will handle sensitive information, concerns, or emotions with appropriate care.

Boeing engineers who raised safety concerns about the 737 MAX found their warnings deprioritized or dismissed. This breakdown in psychological safety prevented critical information from flowing upward, contributing to the eventual catastrophe. [19]

Sullenberger, despite having just met his passengers, created remarkable psychological safety through his calm, clear communication during the crisis. Passengers reported feeling they could trust his directions and voice concerns during evacuation, despite the extreme circumstances. [20]

Intimacy doesn't require personal closeness. It requires creating an environment where truth can be spoken without fear and concerns can be raised without reprisal.

### 4. Self-Orientation: "You focus on my needs, not yours"

Self-orientation is the degree to which you prioritize your own interests over others'. The higher your self-orientation, the lower your trustworthiness. This dimension is so important that in Maister's equation, it's the denominator—as self-orientation approaches zero, trustworthiness approaches infinity.

Boeing's self-orientation was evident throughout the 737 MAX development and crisis response. Decisions consistently prioritized commercial advantages, schedule adherence, and reputation protection over the safety of passengers and the needs of pilots. [21]

Sullenberger demonstrated minimal self-orientation throughout the crisis and its aftermath. From his landing choice that prioritized passenger survival over aircraft preservation to being the last person off the plane, his decisions consistently put others first. Even in subsequent advocacy, he focused on system-level safety improvements rather than personal gain. [22]

Low self-orientation doesn't mean neglecting legitimate self-interest. It means aligning your interests with others' through principled decisions that create value for all stakeholders.

## The Non-Negotiable Pillars of Trustworthiness

While trustworthiness adapts to context, certain foundational elements must remain non-negotiable. These are your trustworthiness bedrock.

### 1. Full Disclosure of Material Information

There's a simple test for what information you must disclose: Would the absence of this information potentially change someone's decision? If yes, disclosure isn't optional.

Boeing's fatal error was withholding critical information about MCAS from pilots. Their rationale—that additional information would require more pilot training, undermining a key selling point—put commercial considerations above pilots' need to know how their aircraft might behave. [23]

Disclosure isn't about data dumping. It's about ensuring those who depend on your decisions have the information they need to give informed consent to that dependence.

### 2. Promise-Keeping as Identity, Not Convenience

Promise-keeping isn't a "best effort" commitment; it's a definition of who you are. As scholar Hannah Arendt noted, "Without being bound to the fulfillment of promises, we would never be able to keep our identities; we would be condemned to wander helplessly and without direction." [24]

Boeing's promises to airlines—minimal pilot training requirements, on-time delivery, fuel efficiency competitive with Airbus—became more important than its implicit promise to the flying public: aircraft that met the highest safety standards. [25]

When promises conflict, the ethical leader acknowledges the conflict openly rather than pretending all promises can be kept simultaneously. Some promises may need to be broken, but this should be done explicitly, with appropriate consequences accepted, not through quiet compromise of the most important commitments.

### 3. Responsibility-Taking, Not Blame-Shifting

When things go wrong, the trustworthy leader steps forward rather than stepping back. They assume responsibility first and determine causes second, rather than making responsibility contingent on causation.

After the Lion Air crash, Boeing's initial response emphasized pilot error and inadequate maintenance rather than acknowledging potential design flaws. This blame-shifting severely damaged their trustworthiness with airlines, pilots, and regulators worldwide. [26]

Responsibility-taking isn't about claiming fault where none exists. It's about acknowledging your role in outcomes, directly addressing concerns, and focusing on solutions rather than blame allocation.

### 4. Principle Consistency Across Contexts

Trustworthiness requires applying the same ethical principles regardless of who's watching or what's at stake. The moment your principles become contextual—strong when convenient, flexible when costly—your trustworthiness becomes suspect.

Boeing's principles shifted based on commercial context. Safety redundancy, always considered fundamental to aircraft design, became negotiable when adhering to it would delay the 737 MAX certification. [27]

Principle consistency doesn't mean contextual blindness. It means applying the same principles across different situations, recognizing that the specific application may vary while the underlying principle remains constant.

## The Trust Barbell Strategy

Trustworthiness isn't built through moderation or middle-of-the-road compromises. It's built through the "barbell strategy" Nassim Taleb describes—combining extreme principle rigidity with extreme tactical flexibility. [28]

On one end of the barbell, your core ethical principles remain absolutely inviolable, regardless of circumstances. These are your non-negotiables, the lines you will not cross under any circumstances.

On the other end, you maintain extreme flexibility in how you implement and express these principles across different contexts. You adapt your communication, your methods, and your approach to the specific situation while never compromising the underlying principles.

You avoid the vulnerable middle—the lukewarm principles that bend under pressure, the half-measures that satisfy no one, the compromises that slowly erode your ethical foundation.

Boeing inverted this model, maintaining rigid commercial commitments while making core safety principles flexible. The result was catastrophic failure. [29]

Sullenberger exemplified the proper trust barbell, remaining absolutely committed to passenger safety while demonstrating remarkable flexibility in his approach to an unprecedented situation. [30]

The barbell strategy acknowledges a fundamental truth: Trustworthiness isn't about finding the comfortable middle ground. It's about knowing precisely which aspects of your approach must never change and which aspects must constantly adapt.

## The Challenge

For the next month, stop trying to be trustworthy. Instead, focus on eliminating reasons to distrust you. Cancel your PR campaign for your own integrity. Instead, put yourself in situations where your trustworthiness will be tested.

Seek out ethical challenges. Volunteer for the projects no one wants because they're ethical minefields. Make decisions that could blow up in your face if you're not rock-solid in your integrity.

Remember: Trustworthiness isn't built in calm waters. It's forged in storms. So sail straight into the hurricane of ethical challenges. If you emerge on the other side, you'll be antifragile. If you don't, well, you were never truly trustworthy to begin with.

Here are five specific challenges to start building your antifragile trustworthiness:

1. **The Truth Bomb**: Identify one truth you've been avoiding telling. Tell it today, respectfully but without sugar-coating.

2. **The Promise Audit**: Review all commitments you've made to stakeholders. Identify any you can't fully keep. Address them directly rather than hoping no one notices.

3. **The Conflict Embrace**: Find a situation where bringing an ethical concern to light will create conflict. Raise it anyway, focusing on the issue rather than personalities.

4. **The Dependency Reduction**: Identify where your trustworthiness is compromised by dependencies (financial, political, relational). Take specific action to reduce one key dependency.

5. **The Skin in the Game Increase**: Find one situation where you're making decisions that affect others but bear minimal personal risk. Restructure your involvement to increase your skin in the game.

Are you ready to stop being a fragile, reputation-obsessed leader and start being an antifragile beacon of genuine trustworthiness? The choice is yours. But choose quickly – the ethical storms are already gathering.

## Reflection Questions

1. Think of a time when you compromised your integrity for a perceived greater good. What were the long-term consequences?

2. How would your decisions change if you knew every choice you made would be public knowledge?

3. What's the hardest thing you've ever done to maintain trust? What did it cost you? Was it worth it?

4. Where in your organization is there a gap between stated values and actual incentives? How does this affect trustworthiness?

5. What dependencies (financial, relational, organizational) most limit your ability to act with complete integrity?

Trustworthiness isn't about perfection. It's about consistent, sometimes painful, choices to prioritize integrity over personal gain, transparency over convenience, and long-term value creation over short-term advantage. It's about building a reputation brick by uncomfortable brick—not by managing impressions but by making decisions you'd be proud to have scrutinized in the cold light of day.

The question isn't whether you can afford to be trustworthy. It's whether you can afford not to be.

## From Principle to Practice

True trustworthiness requires practical tools, not just philosophical commitment. In Part 5 of this book, you'll find the Antifragile Trust Barbell—a structured approach to building trustworthiness that strengthens under pressure. 

This tool guides you through identifying your non-negotiable trust principles, developing flexible implementation approaches, reducing dependencies that compromise trustworthiness, deliberately seeking situations that test your integrity, and eliminating untrustworthy behaviors rather than merely adding trustworthy ones.

By systematically applying this framework to your leadership challenges, you can transform how you approach trustworthiness—moving from fragile reputation management to antifragile integrity that actually gets stronger when tested.

When you're ready to put antifragile trustworthiness into practice, the Antifragile Trust Barbell will help you translate this principle into everyday leadership actions.
