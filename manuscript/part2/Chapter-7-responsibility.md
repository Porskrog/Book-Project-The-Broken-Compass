# Chapter 7: Responsibility - Owning Your Mess (And Everyone Else's)

Think you're responsible because you meet deadlines and don't leave dirty dishes in the office sink? Cute. Real responsibility is about as comfortable as a bed of nails, and twice as revealing.

## The Responsibility Delusion

Here's a shocker for you: The more you talk about being "responsible," the less responsible you probably are. Why? Because truly responsible people are too busy cleaning up messes – theirs and everyone else's – to brag about their dependability.

When disaster struck the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, we witnessed this truth play out on a catastrophic scale. As methane gas surged up the drill column and ignited, killing eleven workers and initiating what would become the largest accidental marine oil spill in history, a fateful pattern was already well established: responsibility had been systematically diffused until it vanished entirely. [1]

In the investigation that followed, a telling pattern emerged. BP officials pointed to Transocean (the rig owner) as the party responsible for operational safety. Transocean pointed to Halliburton (the cement contractor) as responsible for well integrity. Halliburton pointed back to BP as the overall project manager. [2] When investigators asked about critical safety decisions, the universal refrain became a variation of: "That wasn't my responsibility."

This wasn't just corporate finger-pointing after the fact. The diffusion of responsibility had been baked into the operation from the beginning. When cement tests showed problematic results, BP's engineer Brett Cocales dismissed concerns in an email with a phrase that would later become emblematic of the entire disaster: "Who cares, it's done, end of story." [3]

What does true responsibility look like? For that, we need to travel across the world to another disaster that began unfolding less than a year later.

## Radical Responsibility in Action

At 2:46 PM on March 11, 2011, Masao Yoshida, plant director at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, felt the first violent tremor of what would become the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan. As the facility shook around him, automatic safety systems engaged, shutting down the reactors as designed. When external power was lost, emergency diesel generators kicked in. Standard procedure. They had trained for this. [4]

What they hadn't trained for came 41 minutes later, when a 14-meter tsunami – more than twice the height of the plant's protective seawall – crashed over the barriers and flooded the facility. One by one, the backup systems failed: first the diesel generators, then the battery systems, and finally the cooling capabilities for the nuclear fuel. [5]

As radiation levels rose and hydrogen explosions damaged reactor buildings, Yoshida faced an impossible scenario. Corporate headquarters was demanding the preservation of valuable equipment. Government officials issued sometimes contradictory directives. Communication systems were failing. With each passing hour, the specter of catastrophic nuclear meltdown grew more real. [6]

What happened next revealed the stark contrast between diffused responsibility and what we might call radical responsibility. When TEPCO executives ordered Yoshida to stop injecting seawater into the reactors (seawater would permanently damage the equipment but might prevent meltdown), Yoshida did something extraordinary.

On the phone, he said, "I understand" – appearing to comply with the order. Then, turning to his team, he said simply: "Keep pumping the seawater." [7]

In his later testimony, Yoshida explained: "I didn't inform headquarters that we were continuing with the injection. I didn't feel any need to state it explicitly. At that point, we were still able to make judgments on the ground while looking at the actual situation. If we'd stopped [injecting seawater], it would have been dire." [8]

This wasn't mere insubordination. It was the opposite of what happened at Deepwater Horizon. Instead of narrowing his responsibility to "just following orders," Yoshida expanded his responsibility to encompass whatever it would take to prevent catastrophe – even at the risk of his career and legal standing.

These two disasters – Deepwater Horizon and Fukushima – reveal a fundamental truth about responsibility that most leadership books overlook: Real responsibility isn't about staying in your lane. It's about expanding your lane when circumstances demand it.

## The Blame-Dodger's Handbook

Before we examine how to develop this expanded sense of responsibility, let's look at how most "leaders" handle responsibility:

1. **The Delegator Extraordinaire**: "I assigned someone to handle that." Translation: "I washed my hands of it faster than Pontius Pilate."

In the Deepwater Horizon disaster, this manifested as critical safety checks that everyone assumed someone else had performed. The blowout preventer – the last-resort safety device designed to seal the well in an emergency – had a dead battery, a leaking hydraulic system, and a disabled critical component. Each company involved assumed someone else was verifying this essential piece of equipment. [9]

2. **The Process Pundit**: "We followed all the proper procedures." In other words, "The checkbox said we're not liable."

BP had modified its well design to use fewer centralizers (devices that ensure proper cement placement) despite warnings from Halliburton engineers. When concerns were raised, BP representatives responded that Halliburton was being too "conservative." When the cement job later failed, everyone pointed to their adherence to minimal procedural requirements rather than substantive safety outcomes. [10]

3. **The Circumstance Cite**: "Unforeseen circumstances led to this outcome." Read: "I didn't see it coming, so it's not my fault."

The Deepwater Horizon was operating 43 days behind schedule and more than $58 million over budget. Each day of delay cost approximately $1 million in rig rental fees. [11] This pressure led to a systematic discounting of warning signs as "unforeseen circumstances" rather than predictable risks that should have been anticipated and managed.

4. **The Team Player**: "We win or lose as a team." Meaning: "I'll take credit for wins and dilute blame for losses."

At congressional hearings after the disaster, the finger-pointing continued. Transocean's CEO stated: "BP is the operator of this well... They specified the requirements." BP's CEO responded: "This was Transocean's rig... their systems, their people, their equipment." [12] Team accountability became no accountability.

Congratulations. If you've used any of these, you're not responsible. You're a blame artist with a fancy title.

## The Antifragile Approach to Responsibility

Want to know what real responsibility looks like? Brace yourself. It's not pretty, but it's powerful:

1. **The Buck Stops Everywhere**: You're responsible for everything that happens under your watch. Everything.

At Fukushima, Masao Yoshida exemplified this principle. Despite having no formal responsibility for evacuation planning, he coordinated with local officials on evacuation zones. Despite being officially subordinate to corporate decision-makers, he took ownership of the cooling strategy. He expanded his responsibility horizon far beyond his job description. [13]

2. **Problems Are Presents**: Real leaders see problems as gifts.

When conventional cooling systems failed at Fukushima, Yoshida authorized the unprecedented use of fire trucks to pump seawater into the reactors – an improvised solution never contemplated in the plant's design. When radiation made certain areas inaccessible, he redesigned work protocols to limit exposure. Each problem became an opportunity for creative problem-solving. [14]

3. **No "Unforeseen Circumstances"**: There are only two types of problems: Those you predicted and prepared for, and those you should have predicted and prepared for.

The tsunami that struck Fukushima exceeded design parameters. Yet rather than using this as an excuse, Yoshida accepted that the situation – however unexpected – was now his responsibility to manage. When government officials sought to assign blame during the crisis, he deflected to keep focus on containment efforts. [15]

4. **Blame Is for Losers**: The moment you focus on who's to blame, you've lost the responsibility game.

Despite the overwhelming pressure at Fukushima, Yoshida maintained a blame-free environment focused on solutions. When workers made mistakes under extreme stress, he emphasized learning rather than punishment. In his testimony, he took personal responsibility for decisions rather than pointing to systemic failures. [16]

## The Responsibility Equation

Let's make this concrete. Here's the equation you need to understand:

Responsibility = (Ownership × Action) / Excuses

If your excuses are greater than zero, your responsibility trends toward zero. It's simple math, folks.

Consider how this equation played out in our two disaster scenarios:

At Deepwater Horizon, as ownership narrowed and excuses multiplied, responsibility approached zero. Each entity focused only on its contractual obligations, creating gaps where critical safety issues fell through the cracks. [17]

At Fukushima, as Yoshida expanded his ownership and minimized excuses, his responsibility expanded accordingly. Even when he had legitimate reasons to evacuate – radiation levels far exceeding safety limits – he chose to remain with his team. [18]

The consequences of these different approaches were profound:

For Deepwater Horizon:
- Eleven workers killed in the initial explosion
- Approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf
- Economic damages estimated at $8.7 billion across affected industries
- Over 1,300 miles of shoreline contaminated
- Legal settlements, fines, and cleanup costs exceeding $65 billion [19]

For Fukushima:
- Despite the world's second-worst nuclear disaster, not a single immediate fatality due to radiation exposure
- Containment of what could have been a much larger catastrophe
- Systematic evacuation that, while disruptive, prevented widespread radiation sickness [20]

The contrast couldn't be clearer: When responsibility diffuses, disaster expands. When responsibility expands, disaster is contained.

## The Cost of Radical Responsibility

Before you dismiss Yoshida's example as heroic but irrelevant to everyday leadership, consider this: Expanded responsibility always comes with a cost. The question isn't whether you'll pay; it's whether you'll pay willingly or involuntarily.

Yoshida's radical responsibility came at profound personal cost:
- He remained at the plant for weeks, sleeping only 2-3 hours per night
- He absorbed enormous psychological pressure as the final decision-maker
- He accepted radiation exposure well beyond recommended safety limits
- He risked professional censure for defying corporate orders
- He continued working despite deteriorating health, which many believe contributed to his esophageal cancer and death in 2013 at age 58 [21]

Yet he paid this cost willingly, with eyes wide open. As Yoshida reflected in one of his final interviews: "There were many times when I thought I would die. I believed it was my responsibility to manage this situation until the end, even if it cost me my life." [22]

Contrast this with BP, which ultimately paid costs more than 1,000 times greater than what it might have spent on additional safety measures – but did so involuntarily, through legal judgments, cleanup requirements, and reputational damage. [23]

The lesson is clear: You will pay the cost of responsibility, either proactively through devoted attention and resources, or reactively through crises and their aftermath. The proactive price is almost always lower.

## The Leadership Gravity Well

Responsibility operates like gravity. The more mass (authority, resources, capability) you have, the stronger your responsibility gravity should be. Things that might reasonably escape the responsibility gravity of a junior employee should be captured by the stronger gravitational pull of leadership.

Yet all too often, we see the reverse: leaders with the greatest capacity to absorb responsibility actively deflecting it to those with less capacity to manage it. Think of managers who blame frontline workers for systemic failures, executives who take bonuses while laying off staff, or politicians who blame constituents for problems they were elected to solve.

This inverse responsibility pattern creates organizational black holes – places where accountability should exist but doesn't. Problems enter these spaces and disappear from official discussion, only to reemerge later with devastating force.

At Deepwater Horizon, critical safety concerns disappeared into accountability black holes between companies, between departments, and between shifts. [24] At Fukushima, Yoshida created a responsibility gravity well strong enough to capture problems that technically weren't "his" but that needed addressing nonetheless. [25]

## The Antifragile Responsibility Challenge

Ready to stop being a responsibility poser and start being a responsibility beast? Try this:

1. **Catastrophe Catalog**: List every major problem in your organization. Write "I am responsible for this" next to each one. Feel uncomfortable? Good. That's responsibility.

2. **The No-Excuse Day**: Go 24 hours without making a single excuse. Not one. Log every time you're tempted. That's your responsibility weakness showing.

3. **Problem Magnetism**: Actively seek out the biggest, nastiest problem in your organization. The one everyone avoids. Tackle it head-on. That's where responsibility thrives.

4. **The Blame-Free Post-Mortem**: After a failure, run a debrief where the words "fault," "blame," or "should have" are banned. Focus purely on learning and future prevention.

5. **The Responsibility Ripple**: Look at a personal failure. Map out every person it affected, no matter how indirectly. That's the true scope of your responsibility.

## The Long Game

Here's the ultimate test of your responsible leadership: What happens when you're not there?

If your team falls apart without you, you haven't been responsible – you've been a control freak. True responsibility creates systems and people that thrive with or without you.

After the immediate crisis at Fukushima stabilized, Yoshida focused on building sustainable systems for the long-term management of the damaged plant. He trained deputies, documented processes, and established protocols that would function even after his eventual departure. [26]

In contrast, the leadership failures at Deepwater Horizon created systems so dependent on individual vigilance that the absence of any single checkpoint could lead to catastrophe. When those checkpoints failed, there was no backup plan, no resilient system to prevent disaster. [27]

Remember: Responsibility isn't about taking credit or avoiding blame. It's about owning outcomes – good, bad, and ugly – and driving relentlessly toward improvement.

Are you ready to stop playing responsibility whack-a-mole and start being the person everyone counts on when the ship is sinking? The choice is yours. But choose quickly – problems don't wait for you to feel ready.

## From Principle to Practice

True responsibility requires expanding your ownership horizon beyond conventional boundaries. In Part 5 of this book, you'll find the Ownership Expansion Tool – a structured approach to identifying your core, influence, and system circles of responsibility. This tool helps you map blind spots in your current responsibility horizons and develop concrete strategies for expanding ownership where it matters most.

The tool guides you through eliminating blame-focused thinking, finding value in problems, mapping the ripple effects of your decisions, and cultivating a "buck stops everywhere" mindset. By systematically applying this framework to your leadership challenges, you can transform how you and your organization approach responsibility – moving from narrow, defensive ownership to expansive, opportunity-focused responsibility.

When you're ready to put radical responsibility into practice, the Ownership Expansion Tool will help you translate this principle into everyday leadership actions.
