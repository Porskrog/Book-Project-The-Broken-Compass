# Citizenship: Leading Beyond Your Backyard

Think being a good citizen means paying your taxes and occasionally retweeting a cause? Congratulations, you've achieved the bare minimum of not being a societal parasite. Real citizenship in leadership is about as comfortable as performing open-heart surgery on yourself while running a marathon.

## The Citizenship Delusion

Here's a wake-up call for you: The more you tout your "corporate social responsibility" initiatives, the less of a true citizen leader you probably are. Why? Because real citizenship isn't about PR stunts or tax write-offs. It's about making tough choices that benefit society, even when—especially when—it costs you.

The sad truth is that most of what passes for "corporate citizenship" today is window dressing—a thin veneer of social concern barely concealing a ruthless pursuit of profit at any cost. It's the corporate equivalent of putting a "Save the Whales" bumper sticker on your gas-guzzling SUV while tossing plastic bottles out the window.

As we saw in the Enron case, a company can win awards for corporate citizenship while systematically undermining the very social systems that make business possible. Enron's leaders maintained the appearance of civic-mindedness through charitable donations and board memberships even as they were corrupting energy markets, manipulating financial systems, and destroying employee retirement savings. [1]

This disconnect between citizenship rhetoric and reality isn't limited to notorious corporate villains. It's endemic in our business culture, where "citizenship" has been reduced to a marketing strategy rather than a fundamental operating principle.

## The CSR Trap

Let's dissect how most "citizen" leaders operate:

1. **The Greenwasher**: "We've switched to paper straws!" Meanwhile, your supply chain is destroying rainforests.

The banking giant HSBC provides a textbook example of this trap. In October 2022, the UK Advertising Standards Authority banned HSBC advertisements for misleading environmental claims. The bank had been promoting its tree-planting initiatives and commitment to net-zero while simultaneously financing fossil fuel companies to the tune of $110 billion between 2016 and 2021. [2]

2. **The Token Philanthropist**: "We donate 1% of our profits to charity!" Great, what are you doing with the other 99%?

Consider that many corporations trumpet their philanthropic giving while engaging in aggressive tax avoidance strategies that deprive society of far greater resources. In 2020, at least 55 of America's largest corporations paid no federal income taxes despite generating substantial profits. The public resources lost through these strategies dwarf their charitable contributions. [3]

3. **The Diversity Poster Child**: "Look at our inclusive hiring practices!" But your C-suite still looks like a country club board meeting.

Google provides an instructive example. Despite years of public diversity commitments and splashy initiatives, the company's 2021 diversity report showed that Black employees still represented only 4.4% of its workforce and just 3% of leadership—virtually unchanged over seven years of self-proclaimed "commitment" to diversity. [4]

4. **The Legal Minimalist**: "We comply with all regulations." Congratulations on doing the absolute bare minimum to not be a criminal.

Facebook (now Meta) has long insisted it complies with privacy regulations while simultaneously lobbying to weaken those same regulations and exploiting every possible loophole. Internal documents revealed by whistleblower Frances Haugen showed that the company regularly chose growth and engagement over user safety and societal wellbeing. [5]

If any of these sound like you, congratulations. You're not a citizen leader; you're a marketing campaign with a pulse.

## The Antifragile Approach to Citizenship

Real citizenship in leadership is messy, costly, and often unpopular with shareholders. Here's what it actually looks like:

1. **Skin in the Game**: Make decisions that benefit society even when they hurt your bottom line. If it doesn't cost you anything, it's not citizenship; it's a hobby.

When Yvon Chouinard discovered that the steel pitons that formed the foundation of his climbing equipment business were damaging popular climbing rocks, he didn't create a rock restoration foundation while continuing to sell damaging equipment. He discontinued his best-selling product and invested in developing an alternative that would leave no trace—despite significant short-term business risk. [6]

2. **Long-term Vision**: Focus on generational impact, not quarterly reports. Your great-grandchildren should thank you for your choices, not curse your name.

Paul Polman, as CEO of Unilever, eliminated quarterly earnings guidance and oriented the company toward long-term sustainability goals rather than short-term profit maximization. This approach initially faced resistance from Wall Street but ultimately created superior financial returns along with positive environmental and social impact. [7]

3. **Radical Transparency**: Open your books, your practices, and your mistakes to public scrutiny. Real citizens have nothing to hide.

Patagonia's "Footprint Chronicles" provides unprecedented transparency into its supply chain, including information about environmental impact and labor conditions. The company doesn't just disclose positive stories but openly shares challenges and failures, creating accountability that drives improvement. [8]

4. **Active Advocacy**: Use your power and platform to push for systemic changes, even if they might negatively impact your industry. If you're not making enemies, you're not trying hard enough.

CEO Marc Benioff of Salesforce has advocated for higher corporate taxes and regulation of the tech industry, positions that have made him unpopular with many of his peers. He supported a tax on large businesses in San Francisco to address homelessness, even though it cost his own company millions. [9]

## The Citizenship Paradox

Here's where it gets interesting: True citizenship often looks like bad business on the surface. Let's break it down:

1. **Profit Sacrifice**: Sometimes, being a good citizen means leaving money on the table. It's not a loss; it's an investment in a society that allows your business to exist.

CVS Health made the decision in 2014 to stop selling tobacco products, sacrificing $2 billion in annual revenue that represented 3% of the company's total sales. This wasn't a business decision; it was a citizenship decision based on the company's commitment to health. Yet by 2019, the company's stock had outperformed the S&P 500 by 70% since the announcement, showing how citizenship can create long-term value. [10]

2. **Competitive Disadvantage**: Taking the high road might put you behind competitors willing to cut corners. Good. Let them expose themselves as the short-sighted parasites they are.

When Interface Carpet's founder Ray Anderson committed the company to becoming environmentally sustainable in 1994, many analysts predicted the company would be crushed by lower-cost competitors. Instead, the sustainability mission drove innovation that created competitive advantages, while building customer loyalty that allowed for premium pricing. [11]

3. **Stakeholder Friction**: True citizenship might anger shareholders, partners, or even customers. If pleasing everyone is your goal, you're not a leader; you're a people-pleaser with a title.

Dick's Sporting Goods stopped selling assault-style weapons after the Parkland school shooting in 2018, despite knowing it would alienate a segment of their customer base. The company destroyed $5 million worth of inventory rather than returning it to manufacturers. While some customers boycotted the store, overall sales grew, and the company attracted new customers who shared its values. [12]

4. **Self-Disruption**: Being a good citizen might mean disrupting your own successful business model for the greater good. If you don't do it, someone else will—and they won't care about the collateral damage.

Øystein Thoresen, CEO of Norwegian energy company Ørsted (formerly DONG Energy), led a radical transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy starting in 2012. This required divesting profitable coal plants, investing billions in offshore wind, and fundamentally changing the company's business model. While initially risky, the transformation made Ørsted the global leader in offshore wind and increased its market value by 300%. [13]

## The Global Perspective

"But wait," I hear you cry, "in a global economy, what does citizenship even mean?"

Glad you asked. In a global economy, citizenship means:

1. Understanding the ripple effects of your decisions across borders and cultures.
2. Taking responsibility for your entire supply chain, not just the parts you can see.
3. Considering the long-term global impacts of your local decisions.
4. Using your influence to push for universal ethical standards, not just what's convenient for you.

The collapsed Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh provides a stark illustration of citizenship failure in a global context. Major clothing brands that sourced from the factory had delegated responsibility for working conditions to contractors and sub-contractors, creating plausible deniability while benefiting from rock-bottom prices. The disaster, which killed over 1,100 workers, exposed the moral bankruptcy of this approach. [14]

In contrast, companies like Patagonia and Nike have recognized that global citizenship means taking responsibility for working conditions and environmental impacts throughout their supply chains, regardless of whether they directly control those facilities. They've invested in factory monitoring, worker empowerment, and environmental improvements that extend far beyond their direct operations. [15]

## Real-World Example: The Citizen Rebel

Meet Yasmin, a CEO I once worked with. Her board called her "The Citizen Rebel." Why? Because she rebelled against short-term profits in favor of long-term societal benefit.

When a lucrative opportunity arose to expand into a country with questionable human rights practices, Yasmin didn't just say no—she publicly explained why, called out competitors who were jumping in, and used company resources to support human rights organizations.

The board was furious. Shareholders were in uproar. But employees? They were proud to work there. Customers became fiercely loyal. And over time, as ethical concerns became mainstream, Yasmin's "rebellious" stance became a major competitive advantage.

That's citizenship leadership. It's not about being nice or popular. It's about doing what's right, even when—especially when—it's hard.

## The Citizenship Equation

Citizenship = (Impact × Scope × Duration) / (Personal Gain + Comfort)

If your citizenship isn't costing you anything in the short term, you're not doing it right. Real citizenship should feel like a workout for your ethical muscles and your wallet.

Let's break down this equation:

**Impact**: The significance of the positive change your actions create. Minor tweaks to existing systems score low; transformative changes score high.

**Scope**: The breadth of stakeholders affected by your citizenship. Narrow impacts score low; systemic impacts score high.

**Duration**: The sustainability of your contribution. One-time initiatives score low; generational impacts score high.

**Personal Gain**: The benefits you receive from your actions. High personal benefit reduces the citizenship quotient.

**Comfort**: The ease of your actions. Comfortable actions score low on citizenship; difficult, courageous actions score high.

We can see this equation at work in our contrasting cases:
- Enron's leadership had high personal gain, maintained personal comfort, created negative impact of broad scope with long-duration harm—driving their citizenship quotient into negative territory.
- Patagonia's ownership transfer meant zero personal gain (the Chouinard family walked away from billions), high discomfort (giving up control and wealth), potentially transformative environmental impact, global scope, and multi-generational duration—creating an extraordinarily high citizenship quotient.

## The EQ Angle

Let's bring Emotional Intelligence into the citizenship game:

- **Self-Awareness**: Recognize your biases towards your own interests and short-term gains.

Leaders with high EQ understand that we all have a natural tendency toward self-interest and short-term thinking. They actively monitor these tendencies rather than denying them, creating space for more citizenship-oriented choices.

- **Self-Regulation**: Control your impulse to take the easy road or the path of least resistance.

Paul Polman's decision to eliminate quarterly guidance at Unilever demonstrates this principle. He recognized the impulse to manage for short-term market reactions and deliberately implemented structures to resist that impulse. [16]

- **Motivation**: Be driven by legacy and impact, not just profits and accolades.

Rose Marcario, former CEO of Patagonia, explains: "When you're clear about your purpose, it's easier to make decisions that might appear financially counterintuitive in the short term but create tremendous value in the long run." [17]

- **Empathy**: Use it to understand the broader implications of your decisions on diverse stakeholders.

Hamdi Ulukaya, founder of Chobani, demonstrates this through his commitment to hiring refugees and paying living wages to factory workers—choices that stem from genuine empathy for vulnerable populations rather than PR considerations. [18]

- **Social Skills**: Use them to build coalitions for change, not just to network for personal gain.

Interface's Ray Anderson became an environmental advocate who brought together competitors, suppliers, and customers to advance sustainability across the entire industry, not just within his company. [19]

## The Fine Line: Citizenship vs. Martyrdom

There's a fine line between being a good corporate citizen and running your business into the ground. Here's how to walk it:

1. **Sustainable Impact**: Your citizenship efforts should strengthen your business in the long run, not cripple it.

Citizenship isn't about self-sacrifice for its own sake. The goal is to create sustainable positive impact, which requires a viable business model. Patagonia's focus on quality and durability doesn't just reduce environmental impact; it creates products customers are willing to pay premium prices for, enabling the company's other citizenship efforts. [20]

2. **Strategic Focus**: You can't solve every problem. Choose areas where your business can have the most meaningful impact.

Microsoft has focused its citizenship efforts on areas that align with its core capabilities, like digital skills training and AI ethics. This focused approach creates more significant impact than attempting to address every social or environmental challenge. [21]

3. **Measurable Outcomes**: Track the actual impact of your citizenship efforts, not just the money spent or PR generated.

Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan established specific, measurable targets for environmental impact reduction and social improvement, with regular progress reporting against these metrics. This accountability transformed vague commitments into concrete results. [22]

4. **Integrate, Don't Separate**: Citizenship should be part of your core strategy, not a separate "CSR department."

When Danone became a certified B Corporation, CEO Emmanuel Faber integrated social and environmental goals into core business objectives and executive compensation, rather than treating them as peripheral activities. [23]

5. **Lead, Don't Follow**: Set new standards for your industry instead of just meeting existing ones.

Tesla didn't just meet existing fuel efficiency standards; it created fully electric vehicles that helped transform the entire automotive industry's approach to sustainability. [24]

## The Antifragile Citizenship Challenge

Ready to stop being a citizenship poser and start being a force for change? Try these:

1. **The Profit Sacrifice**: Identify a profitable but ethically questionable part of your business. Eliminate it. Publicly.

2. **The Supply Chain Deep Dive**: Trace your top-selling product's supply chain to its roots. Fix the biggest ethical issue you find, whatever the cost.

3. **The Whistleblower Welcome**: Create a program that rewards employees for exposing ethical issues in your company. Actually listen and act on what you hear.

4. **The Competitor Callout**: Publicly challenge your industry to meet a higher ethical standard, even if you're not quite there yet yourself.

5. **The Long-term Lockdown**: Tie executive bonuses to 25-year impact metrics, not quarterly results. Watch priorities change overnight.

## The Citizen Leader's Manifesto

1. I commit to considering the societal impact of every major business decision.
2. I pledge to use my company's resources and influence to address systemic issues, not just symptoms.
3. I vow to be transparent about our failures and challenges, not just our successes.
4. I promise to advocate for regulations that benefit society, even if they constrain my industry.
5. I dedicate myself to building a business that I'd be proud to have my great-grandchildren inherit.

## The Spectrum of Corporate Citizenship

Not all citizenship is created equal. The Citizenship Spectrum provides a framework for understanding different levels of corporate citizenship:

### 1. Parasitic Citizenship
At the lowest end of the spectrum, companies actively damage social and environmental systems while extracting maximum value. They externalize costs to society, lobby against public interest regulations, and rely on stakeholder ignorance. Enron exemplified this approach, manipulating markets, deceiving stakeholders, and undermining regulatory systems while presenting a facade of good citizenship. [25]

### 2. Compliance Citizenship
A step up from parasitic, compliance-focused companies meet minimum legal requirements but view citizenship entirely through a risk-management lens. They do what's required to avoid penalties and reputation damage, but no more. This approach treats citizenship as a constraint rather than a responsibility. [26]

### 3. Strategic Citizenship
Companies at this level view citizenship through a business case lens, engaging in social and environmental initiatives when they align with business interests. While a significant improvement over compliance, this approach is still fundamentally self-interested, with societal benefit as a secondary outcome rather than a primary goal. [27]

### 4. Integrated Citizenship
At this level, companies build citizenship into their core business models, recognizing that long-term business success requires healthy social and environmental systems. They make citizenship a central consideration in strategic decisions rather than a peripheral activity. Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan exemplifies this approach. [28]

### 5. Regenerative Citizenship
The highest level of citizenship focuses not just on reducing harm but on actively improving the systems in which the business operates. These companies aim to leave society and the environment better than they found them. Patagonia's commitment to regenerative agriculture and its 2022 ownership transfer to environmental causes represent this approach. [29]

The movement from lower to higher levels on this spectrum requires progressively more leadership courage, longer time horizons, and greater willingness to question fundamental business assumptions. It also creates progressively more significant and sustainable value, both for society and, paradoxically, for the business itself.

## The Citizenship Imperative

Citizenship isn't optional. By operating in society, using public infrastructure, employing educated workers, and relying on stable markets, your business has already taken from the social commons. The question is not whether you'll engage in citizenship but whether your citizenship will be extractive or regenerative.

The great economist Howard Bowen recognized this as early as 1953 when he wrote that businesspeople have "an obligation to pursue those policies, to make those decisions, or to follow those lines of action which are desirable in terms of the objectives and values of our society." [30]

This obligation has only grown more urgent as businesses have gained power relative to governments and as the scale of social and environmental challenges has increased. Climate change, inequality, technological disruption, and institutional fragmentation create citizenship imperatives that no business leader can legitimately ignore.

The stakes of citizenship failure are equally clear. Enron's collapse destroyed billions in value and thousands of jobs. The 2008 financial crisis, precipitated in part by a financial industry that prioritized short-term profit over systemic responsibility, cost the global economy an estimated $22 trillion. [31]

On the other hand, citizenship leadership creates outsized value, both for society and for businesses themselves. Unilever's purpose-driven brands grew 69% faster than the rest of the business and delivered 75% of the company's growth. [32] Patagonia's focus on environmental responsibility has helped it build a billion-dollar brand with customer loyalty that luxury companies envy. [33]

## The Long-Term View

Here's the ultimate test of your citizenship leadership: In 50 years, will your company be cited as part of the solution or part of the problem? Will future case studies laud your foresight or condemn your short-sightedness?

Remember: Citizenship isn't about being a nice corporate neighbor. It's about being a driving force for positive change in society. It's about using your power, your resources, and your influence to leave the world better than you found it.

Are you ready to stop playing citizenship theater and start being a true leader in societal progress? The choice is yours. But choose quickly – the world's problems aren't waiting for your next CSR report.

## Reflection Questions

1. What's the biggest negative externality your business creates? What would it cost to eliminate it? What's stopping you?

2. How would your decision-making change if you had to publicly justify every major choice in terms of its societal impact?

3. What systemic issue in your industry are you uniquely positioned to address? What's holding you back?

4. How can you use your company's core competencies to address a major societal challenge?

5. If you had to tie your personal wealth to your company's 100-year impact on society, what would you do differently starting tomorrow?

The path of true citizenship in leadership is expensive, risky, and often thankless. But it's the only path that leads to a legacy worth having. Are you citizen enough to take it?

## From Principle to Practice: The Systemic Impact Evaluator

True citizenship requires more than good intentions—it requires systematic assessment of your organization's impact on the broader systems it operates within. In Part 5 of this book, you'll find the Systemic Impact Evaluator—a structured approach to mapping your organization's societal footprint, evaluating your time horizons, assessing your transparency practices, measuring your skin in the game, and amplifying your advocacy for positive change.

This tool guides you through expanding your perspective beyond organizational boundaries to understand your true impact, both positive and negative. It helps you identify opportunities to transition from extractive to regenerative citizenship and develop practical strategies for creating positive systemic change.

By systematically applying this framework to your leadership challenges, you can transform how you think about your organization's role in society—moving from narrow self-interest to a broader understanding of citizenship as core to both your social license to operate and your long-term business success.

When you're ready to put these principles into practice, the Systemic Impact Evaluator will help you translate citizenship philosophy into concrete leadership actions.
