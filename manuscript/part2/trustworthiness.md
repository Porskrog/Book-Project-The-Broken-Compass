# Trustworthiness: The Antifragile Virtue

## DRAFT SKETCH - TO BE EXPANDED

[Note: This builds on elements from existing draft, enhancing it with more practical applications and connections to institutional fragmentation]

Consider this paradox: The more you obsess over your trustworthy reputation, the more fragile that reputation becomes. Welcome to the counterintuitive world of ethical leadership.

## The Reputation Trap

You, eager leader, think you're building trust by carefully manicuring your image. You're wrong. Dead wrong. With every calculated move to appear trustworthy, you're constructing a house of cards, not a fortress of integrity.

Why? Because you're playing defense, not offense. You're trying not to lose trust instead of genuinely embodying trustworthiness. It's a sucker's game, and you're the sucker.
