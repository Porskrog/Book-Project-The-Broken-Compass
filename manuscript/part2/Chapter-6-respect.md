# Chapter 6: Respect - The Virtue You Lose by Trying to Earn

Think you're respectful because you say "please" and "thank you"? Congratulations, you've mastered kindergarten-level ethics. Real respect, the kind that forms the bedrock of true leadership, isn't about politeness. It's about having the guts to be honest when it hurts.

## The Respect Trap

Here's a mind-bender for you: The more you try to be respectful, the less respectful you become. Why? Because you're not respecting the other person's intelligence. You're infantilizing them, assuming they can't handle the truth.

Remember that manager who gave vague, positive feedback to avoid hurting feelings? They weren't being respectful. They were being a coward, denying their team the opportunity to grow.

Or that CEO who kept quiet about impending layoffs to "maintain morale"? That's not respect. That's manipulation, pure and simple.

Consider the case of Uber under Travis Kalanick's leadership. In the name of "respecting" technical brilliance, Uber created a culture where sexual harassment, discrimination, and bullying were tolerated from "high performers." [1] This wasn't respect; it was its opposite—devaluing people's dignity in service of narrow technical achievement.

Contrast this with aviation's transformation following the 1977 Tenerife disaster, where 583 people died partly because junior officers were too "respectful" to forcefully challenge a captain's fatal error. This tragedy sparked a revolution in understanding respect, creating systems where junior crew members are now trained to escalate challenges—even to the point of taking physical control—when safety requires it. [2]

Real respect is tough. It's telling an employee they're underperforming. It's admitting to stakeholders that a project is off track. It's disagreeing with your boss when they're wrong.

## The Antifragile Respect Strategy

1. **Brutal Honesty**: Respect people enough to tell them the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. Sugar-coating isn't respect; it's condescension.

   When a KLM flight began takeoff without clearance in Tenerife, the flight engineer's tentative expression of concern ("Is he not clear, that Pan American?") was insufficient to prevent disaster. Modern aviation training teaches a far more direct approach: "STOP! Pan Am is still on the runway!" This directness isn't rude—it respects the value of human life. [3]

2. **High Expectations**: Set the bar high. Expecting less from someone because of their background or circumstances? That's not respect; it's soft bigotry.

   Uber's failure wasn't just tolerating bad behavior from "high performers." It was setting pathetically low expectations for how brilliant people should treat others. True respect would have meant saying, "You're too talented to behave this way. We expect more from you." [4]

3. **Allowing Failure**: Let people fail. Swooping in to save them isn't respect; it's robbing them of growth opportunities.

   When United Airlines Flight 232 suffered catastrophic hydraulic failures in 1989, Captain Al Haynes respected his crew enough to openly admit, "I need everybody's input on this." This vulnerability—this willingness to acknowledge the limits of his own expertise—created space for collaborative problem-solving that saved 185 lives. [5]

4. **Embracing Conflict**: Foster healthy disagreement. A team that never argues is a team that never innovates. Real respect means valuing diverse opinions, not enforcing artificial harmony.

   Susan Fowler's experience at Uber revealed a culture where raising concerns was punished rather than welcomed. When she reported sexual harassment, HR sided with the "high performer" and later penalized her for continuing to speak up. This wasn't just a failure of respect; it was a catastrophic waste of valuable perspective. [6]

## The Respect Paradox

Here's where it gets interesting: True respect often looks like its opposite. Let's break it down:

1. **Challenging Ideas**: Respecting someone's idea doesn't mean agreeing with it. It means taking it seriously enough to critique it rigorously.

   Before the Tenerife disaster, cockpit culture emphasized superficial deference, where junior officers avoided directly challenging captains' decisions. Today's aviation practices demonstrate true respect through explicit challenge protocols, recognizing that rigorous questioning shows deeper respect than silent deference. [7]

2. **Giving Tough Assignments**: Handing someone an impossible task isn't setting them up for failure. It's showing you believe they're capable of the extraordinary.

   At Uber, women engineers rarely received challenging assignments, with managers assuming they couldn't handle technical complexity. This wasn't protection; it was profound disrespect for their capabilities, contributing to the mass exodus of female talent. [8]

3. **Allowing Consequences**: Shielding people from the results of their actions isn't respect. It's infantilization. Real respect means allowing people to experience the full weight of their choices.

   Aviation's transformation wasn't about eliminating hierarchy but about creating accountability at all levels. Modern cockpit protocols respect pilots enough to hold them accountable for both actions and inactions that affect safety. When consequences are clear, growth is possible. [9]

4. **Saying No**: Constantly saying yes isn't respect. It's people-pleasing. Respect means being willing to disappoint people in the short term for their long-term benefit.

   Uber's reluctance to say "no" to toxic behavior from high performers might have seemed like respect for technical talent, but it was actually profound disrespect for the organization and all its stakeholders. True respect would have meant establishing and enforcing clear boundaries. [10]

## The Empathy Angle

Now, I can hear the objections. "But what about being kind and understanding? Isn't that part of respect?"

Sure, empathy is crucial. But here's the kicker: Most leaders use "empathy" as an excuse for cowardice. They avoid tough conversations under the guise of being "understanding." That's not empathy; that's abdication of leadership.

Real empathy in respect means:

1. Understanding someone's perspective, but not necessarily agreeing with it.
2. Acknowledging emotions, but not being ruled by them.
3. Considering circumstances, but not using them as excuses for lower standards.

The transformation in aviation after Tenerife demonstrates this perfectly. Modern cockpit culture balances empathy with directness. Captains understand the psychological challenges junior officers face in speaking up, so they actively create conditions that make challenge possible. This isn't about ignoring emotions; it's about creating systems where emotions don't override safety. [11]

## Real-World Example: The Respectful Rebel

Meet Alex, a CTO I once worked with. His team called him "The Respectful Rebel." Why? Because he respected his team enough to rebel against corporate BS.

When upper management pushed for an unrealistic deadline, Alex pushed back - hard. "I respect my team too much to set them up for failure," he said in a board meeting. "And I respect this company too much to deliver a half-baked product."

The board was furious. But Alex's team? They would have walked through fire for him. Because he showed them real respect - not by being nice, but by being honest and fighting for their best interests.

This parallels how Dara Khosrowshahi began rebuilding Uber's culture after Kalanick's departure. He showed respect not through empty platitudes but through concrete actions: establishing clear behavioral expectations, holding people accountable regardless of technical brilliance, and explicitly linking ethics to business outcomes. [12]

## The Respect Equation

Respect = (Truth-telling × High Standards) / Comfort

If your respect isn't making someone uncomfortable occasionally, it's not real respect. It's just platitudes.

Consider the equation in the context of our case studies:

At Uber under Kalanick, comfort was maximized for "high performers" while truth-telling and standards (for behavior) were minimized. The result was near-zero actual respect. [13]

In modern aviation, truth-telling and standards are maximized even when it creates momentary discomfort. The result is genuinely respectful cockpit environments where lives are saved through challenging conversations. [14]

## The EQ Twist

Let's bring Emotional Intelligence into the respect game:

- **Self-Awareness**: Recognize when your "respect" is actually fear of conflict or desire for approval.

  Uber's leadership lacked the self-awareness to recognize that their tolerance of toxic behavior wasn't about respecting talent; it was about avoiding uncomfortable confrontations and maintaining growth at all costs. [15]

- **Self-Regulation**: Control your impulse to soften hard truths.

  Modern aviation explicitly trains pilots in self-regulation techniques to manage their emotional responses to being challenged. Captains learn to welcome challenges rather than reacting defensively. [16]

- **Motivation**: Be driven by long-term growth, not short-term comfort.

  The transformation in aviation was motivated by a commitment to safety that transcended individual ego. This long-term focus made it possible to overcome the short-term discomfort of changing deeply ingrained hierarchical patterns. [17]

- **Empathy**: Use it to understand how to deliver tough messages effectively, not to avoid delivering them.

  Crew Resource Management training specifically addresses how to deliver challenges in ways that maintain the captain's authority while clearly communicating critical information. This nuanced approach demonstrates real empathy. [18]

- **Social Skills**: Use them to build relationships strong enough to withstand honesty and conflict.

  Aviation's brief but crucial "Two Communication Rule" works because it's embedded in a broader culture of mutual respect. The relationship foundation makes the direct communication effective rather than offensive. [19]

## The Fine Line: Respect vs. Rudeness

There's a fine line between honest respect and outright rudeness. Here's how to walk it:

1. **Intention Matters**: Your tough truths should come from a place of genuine respect and desire for the other person's growth. If you're being harsh out of anger or ego, you've crossed the line.

   The difference between a helpful challenge in an airplane cockpit and a disrespectful outburst isn't just the words used but the intention behind them. Effective challenges are always mission-focused, not ego-driven. [20]

2. **Timing and Setting**: There's a time and place for everything. Criticizing someone in public isn't respect; it's humiliation. Choose your moments wisely.

   One of Uber's biggest respect failures was allowing public humiliation in meetings. Employees reported being criticized in front of peers in ways designed to showcase the critic's intelligence rather than help the recipient improve. [21]

3. **Offer Solutions**: Pointing out problems without offering potential solutions isn't respect; it's complaining. Always couple critique with constructive suggestions.

   Modern aviation training emphasizes solution-oriented challenges. Rather than simply saying "You're too low," a first officer might say "We're below the glideslope; recommend increasing power now." [22]

4. **Listen Actively**: Respect is a two-way street. If you're doing all the talking, you're not respecting the other person's voice.

   When Captain Al Haynes faced the unprecedented emergency of United 232, he actively solicited input from all crew members and incorporated their suggestions. This wasn't weakness; it was the highest form of respectful leadership. [23]

5. **Acknowledge Effort**: Recognizing someone's effort (even if the result falls short) isn't coddling; it's fair. Couple it with honest feedback for best results.

   Dara Khosrowshahi's approach to rebuilding Uber included acknowledging the positive aspects of the company's drive while firmly addressing its ethical failures. This balanced approach demonstrated authentic respect. [24]

## The Antifragile Respect Challenge

Ready to stop being a respect poser and start being a beacon of real respect? Try these:

1. **The Truth Bomb**: Identify one truth you've been avoiding telling. Tell it today, respectfully but without sugar-coating.

2. **The Standard Elevator**: Raise your standards for someone you've been underestimating. Tell them why you're doing it.

3. **The Constructive Conflict**: Find a colleague you always agree with. Actively look for something to respectfully disagree about.

4. **The Failure Allow**: Let someone on your team fail at something (safely). Then help them learn from it.

5. **The Respect Reciprocity**: Ask for brutally honest feedback about your performance. Thank the person for respecting you enough to be honest.

## The Respectful Leader's Manifesto

1. I respect you enough to tell you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable.
2. I respect you enough to hold you to high standards.
3. I respect you enough to let you fail and learn.
4. I respect you enough to disagree with you openly.
5. I respect you enough to put long-term growth over short-term comfort.

## The Long-Term View

Here's the ultimate test of your respectful leadership: Do people seek you out for honest feedback, even when it hurts? If yes, you're doing it right. If they're avoiding you or only coming to you for validation, you've failed at real respect.

The long-term impact of genuine respect is undeniable. Aviation's transformation from hierarchical deference to respectful challenge has created one of the safest transportation systems in human history, with the fatal accident rate dropping from approximately 2.0 per million flights in the mid-1970s to 0.1 by 2019. [25]

Conversely, Uber's failure to implement genuine respect contributed to massive talent flight (particularly among women), brand damage, and eventually the founder's ouster—with quantifiable business impacts including the loss of market share from 91% to 70% between 2016 and 2019. [26]

Remember: Respect isn't about making people feel good. It's about helping them be good. It's about creating resilient, capable individuals who can handle the truth and use it to grow.

Are you ready to stop confusing politeness with respect and start truly respecting your team, your peers, and yourself? The choice is yours. But choose quickly – in a world of yes-men and sycophants, real respect is a rare and valuable commodity.

## The Respectful Challenger Framework in Action

Let's see how the Respectful Challenger Framework transforms real leadership scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Performance Feedback

**Traditional "Respectful" Approach**:
"You're doing well, but there might be a few areas for improvement. Maybe try to be a bit more detail-oriented? But overall, great job!"

**Genuine Respect Approach**:
"Your strategic thinking is excellent, which is why I'm concerned about the consistent errors in your reports. These mistakes undermine your brilliant ideas. I believe you're capable of much better work, and I need you to implement a systematic quality check before submitting. Let's meet next week to review how it's working."

### Scenario 2: Disagreeing with Leadership

**Traditional "Respectful" Approach**:
"I see your point about the deadline, and I'll certainly do my best to meet it." [Privately knowing it's impossible while saying nothing]

**Genuine Respect Approach**:
"I respect this project too much to commit to a deadline I know we can't meet. Based on our previous similar projects, we need at least two more weeks to deliver quality work. I can show you the data that supports this timeline, and I'm open to discussing ways we might accelerate specific components if absolutely necessary."

### Scenario 3: Team Conflict

**Traditional "Respectful" Approach**:
"Let's all try to get along. Everyone has valid perspectives, and we need to be more understanding of each other."

**Genuine Respect Approach**:
"I'm noticing we have a fundamental disagreement about the direction of this project. Rather than papering over this conflict, I'd like to explicitly address it. Rachel, you believe we should prioritize speed to market. Mark, you're advocating for additional feature development first. Both views have merit, but we need to resolve this tension. Let's spend the next 30 minutes having each side present their strongest case with data, then make a clear decision."

## Applying the Respectful Challenger Framework

The Respectful Challenger Framework provides a structured approach to transforming superficial politeness into genuine respect through deliberate challenge and honesty. Here's how to implement it:

### Step 1: Respect Paradox Identification
Recognize situations where avoiding confrontation actually shows disrespect.

Ask yourself:
- Am I withholding concerns to avoid conflict?
- Am I allowing substandard performance because I don't want to hurt feelings?
- Am I agreeing in public but complaining in private?

**Case Example**: At Uber, women engineers reported concerns to HR about sexual harassment, only to have them dismissed or minimized. This avoidance of confrontation with "high performers" demonstrated profound disrespect for the women affected. [27]

### Step 2: Truth Threshold Establishment
Define your criteria for when you will share uncomfortable truths.

Develop rules such as:
- I will always speak up when safety or ethics are at risk
- I will never let short-term comfort override long-term success
- I will raise concerns immediately rather than letting them fester

**Case Example**: Modern aviation has established explicit protocols for when crew members must speak up, with the "Two-Challenge Rule" requiring co-pilots to speak up twice if they see a safety issue. This clear threshold removes ambiguity about when challenging is necessary. [28]

### Step 3: Higher Expectations Calibration
Set standards based on potential, not comfort.

In practice:
- Set stretch goals that show faith in capabilities
- Require excellence in both technical and behavioral dimensions
- Refuse to accept "that's just how they are" as an excuse

**Case Example**: After Dara Khosrowshahi replaced Travis Kalanick at Uber, he established new cultural norms that explicitly raised behavioral expectations, making clear that technical brilliance didn't exempt anyone from treating others with respect. [29]

### Step 4: Constructive Conflict Strategy
Create structures that enable productive disagreement.

Implement approaches like:
- Designated devil's advocate roles in meetings
- Structured debate formats for key decisions
- Recognition for those who raise valid concerns

**Case Example**: Aviation's post-Tenerife transformation included creating explicit invitation for challenge, with captains beginning flights by saying, "If you see anything that concerns you, I expect you to speak up immediately." This structure legitimizes constructive conflict. [30]

### Step 5: Genuine Respect Check-in
Continuously evaluate whether your approach is building or eroding respect.

Monitor indicators such as:
- Do people seek your feedback or avoid it?
- Is information flowing freely, including bad news?
- Do team members challenge each other productively?

**Case Example**: United Airlines Flight 232's successful emergency handling under Captain Al Haynes demonstrated the outcome of genuine respect—team members freely offering crucial insights without fear, resulting in lives saved through collaborative problem-solving. [31]

## Reflection Questions

1. Think of a time when someone respected you enough to tell you a hard truth. How did it impact you?

   Consider how United Airlines' Captain Denny Flanagan reflected on the day he began explicitly asking his crew to challenge him: "It wasn't a surrender of authority—it was the wisest use of it." [32]

2. What's the most difficult truth you need to tell someone out of respect? What's holding you back?

   Remember how Uber's silence about misconduct allowed problems to grow until they exploded into public scandal. What problem might you be incubating through your silence? [33]

3. How might your desire to be seen as "respectful" be holding back your team or organization?

   Aviation discovered that the desire to maintain "respectful" cockpit harmony was directly contributing to accidents. What accidents—literal or figurative—might your harmony-seeking be enabling? [34]

4. In what ways can you raise your standards to show more respect for your team's capabilities?

   After Dara Khosrowshahi took over Uber, one of his first acts was raising standards by declaring "We do the right thing. Period"—signaling respect for employees' ethical capabilities rather than just their technical skills. [35]

5. How would your leadership change if you optimized for long-term growth and resilience rather than short-term harmony?

   Aviation's transformation from deferential hierarchy to challenge-friendly culture initially created discomfort but ultimately built a system with extraordinary safety and resilience. What might similar transformation unlock in your context? [36]

The path of true respect in leadership is challenging and often misunderstood. But it's the only path that leads to real growth, both for you and those you lead. Are you respectful enough to take it?

## From Principle to Practice

True respect requires a fundamental shift in mindset—from viewing respect as deference or politeness to understanding it as valuing others enough to be honest with them. In Part 5 of this book, you'll find the Respectful Challenger Framework—a structured approach to transforming superficial politeness into genuine respect through deliberate challenge and honesty.

This framework guides you through identifying respect paradoxes in your organization, establishing truth thresholds for when uncomfortable honesty is required, calibrating appropriately high expectations, developing constructive conflict strategies, and continuously evaluating whether your approach is building genuine respect. By systematically applying this framework to your leadership challenges, you can create environments where truth is spoken, potential is fulfilled, and respect is demonstrated through meaningful action rather than empty platitudes.

When you're ready to put these principles into practice, the Respectful Challenger Framework will help you translate the respect paradox into everyday leadership behaviors that create growth rather than comfort.
