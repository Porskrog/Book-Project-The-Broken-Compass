# The Systemic Impact Evaluator

## Purpose
To help leaders assess and maximize their broader impact beyond organizational boundaries. This tool addresses the problem of narrowly focused leadership that ignores societal consequences and opportunities, resulting in short-term gains at the expense of long-term value and societal legitimacy.

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Impact Mapping**: Identify the organization's full societal footprint
   - Map direct and indirect impacts on various stakeholders
   - Assess both positive and negative externalities of organizational activities

2. **Horizon Extension**: Shift perspective from quarterly to generational thinking
   - Evaluate decisions across different time horizons (1 year, 10 years, 50 years)
   - Identify opportunities for long-term positive impacts

3. **Transparency Assessment**: Evaluate the transparency of organizational practices
   - Assess how well stakeholders can see and understand the organization's actions
   - Identify areas where increased transparency can build trust and improve practice

4. **Skin in the Game Measurement**: Quantify personal/organizational costs of ethical choices
   - Calculate the costs of standing by principles
   - Define boundaries for acceptable sacrifices for principles

5. **Advocacy Amplification**: Examine how organizational influence can drive positive change
   - Identify systemic issues where the organization has a unique position to create change
   - Develop strategies to mobilize resources and influence toward positive systemic outcomes

## Reflection Questions
1. How will your organization be judged by history 50 years from now?
2. What negative externalities of your organization are invisible or ignored today?
3. Where do you let short-term pressure compromise long-term principles?
4. What systemic issues is your organization uniquely positioned to influence?
5. If your organization's impact on society were measured with the same weight as its financial results, how would you fare?

## Case Example
Michael, a leader in a textile company, was under pressure to reduce costs by choosing cheaper suppliers with poorer working conditions. Rather than following the industry's normal practice, he implemented The Systemic Impact Evaluator:

- **Impact Mapping**: He mapped the full supply chain and identified that poor working conditions at suppliers indirectly damaged the company's brand and employee morale.
- **Horizon Extension**: He modeled how investments in ethical suppliers would affect the company over 1, 10, and 25 years.
- **Transparency Assessment**: He instituted full transparency in supplier relationships and working conditions.
- **Skin in the Game**: He accepted that this would reduce margins by 2% in the short term, and explained this honestly to the board.
- **Advocacy Amplification**: He formed an industry coalition to work toward better standards, which reduced the competitive disadvantage of his own choice.

The board was skeptical but accepted the plan on a two-year trial. After 18 months, results showed that while margins were marginally lower, employee engagement, customer loyalty, and brand value had all increased. The company began attracting customers who valued their ethical approach, and employee turnover dropped by 37%.
