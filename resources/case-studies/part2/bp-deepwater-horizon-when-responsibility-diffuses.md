# Case Study: BP Deepwater Horizon
### When Responsibility Diffuses Until No One Is Accountable

## The Catastrophic Failure of Ownership

At 9:49 PM on April 20, 2010, Mike Williams, the chief electronics technician aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, was watching TV in his cabin when he felt the entire structure shake. The lights flickered. Monitors went dark. Then came a deafening hiss—the sound of high-pressure methane gas escaping up the drill column.

"I knew we were in trouble," Williams would later recall. "I knew this was going to be bad." [1]

Seconds later, the gas found an ignition source. The resulting explosion ripped through the rig with such force that Williams was thrown against a wall. As he stumbled to his feet, he saw that the ceiling had collapsed. Fire alarms blared. Emergency lights pulsed red in the smoke-filled corridor. Making his way to the external deck, Williams saw something that seemed impossible—the massive drilling platform was engulfed in flames, burning like a matchstick in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. [1]

What followed would become the largest accidental marine oil spill in history. For 87 days, oil gushed uncontrolled into the Gulf. Before it was finally capped, approximately 4.9 million barrels (210 million gallons) of crude oil had contaminated the waters and shorelines of the Gulf Coast. [2] Eleven workers died in the initial explosion. Thousands of marine animals perished. Fishing and tourism industries along five states suffered billions in economic damage. [3]

But this wasn't just an industrial accident. It was a catastrophic failure of responsibility at multiple levels—a case study in how diffused accountability can lead to disaster when no one truly owns the outcome.

## The Systems at Stake

To understand the magnitude of what happened, it helps to understand what BP and its contractors were attempting.

Deepwater Horizon was a semi-submersible drilling rig operating in approximately 5,000 feet of water. Its mission was to drill an exploratory well called Macondo in the Mississippi Canyon, a particularly challenging section of the Gulf of Mexico. The well itself would eventually reach a total depth of about 18,000 feet below the ocean floor—roughly the height of six Empire State Buildings stacked on top of each other. [4]

At such depths, the engineering challenges are enormous:

- Extremely high pressures that can cause hydrocarbons to force their way up the well
- Near-freezing temperatures that can cause equipment failures and hydrate formation
- Remote operations requiring complex coordination between multiple teams and companies
- Limited emergency response options due to the distance from shore [4]

Deepwater drilling inherently involves risk management. The question isn't whether challenges will arise, but how they'll be handled when they do. This is where responsibility becomes critical.

The Deepwater Horizon operation involved multiple companies with different roles:

- BP was the lease operator and overall project manager
- Transocean owned and operated the drilling rig
- Halliburton was responsible for cementing operations to seal the well
- Various other contractors handled specific aspects of the operation [2]

This complex web of corporate relationships created the perfect environment for responsibility to become dangerously diffused.

## The Cascade of Irresponsibility

The events leading to the blowout weren't the result of a single catastrophic decision, but rather a series of choices where responsibility was repeatedly diminished, delegated, or denied.

### Cost Over Safety: The Pressure from Above

BP had experienced significant cost overruns on the Macondo well. By April 2010, the project was more than $58 million over budget and 43 days behind schedule. Each day of delay cost approximately $1 million in rig rental fees alone. [5]

In emails uncovered during subsequent investigations, BP managers emphasized the need to cut costs and speed up operations. "The DW Horizon has been a huge success for everyone," wrote BP drilling operations manager David Sims on April 16, just four days before the disaster. "We must not become complacent," he added, "the demand on our services is high which is in our favor." [6]

This pressure trickled down. When engineers proposed additional safety measures that would add time to the schedule, they were often overruled. According to testimony from multiple workers, the standard refrain became: "This is how it's going to be" or "We don't have time for that." [7]

John Guide, BP's wells team leader, justified numerous decisions to expedite operations by explaining: "This is a business decision." [7]

### The "Not My Job" Syndrome

As pressure mounted, a dangerous attitude emerged across the operation: problems became someone else's responsibility.

When Halliburton engineers raised concerns about the cementing plan, they were told by BP representatives that they were being too "conservative." When the cement failed multiple pressure tests—a critical warning sign—the results were either misinterpreted or ignored entirely. [8]

BP's own guidelines required additional testing after problematic cement jobs. Those tests were never conducted. When investigators later asked why, BP officials pointed to Halliburton as the cementing expert, while Halliburton pointed back to BP as the overall project manager. [9]

This pattern repeated across virtually every critical safety decision:

- BP modified the well design to use fewer centralizers (devices that ensure proper cement placement) despite Halliburton's warnings [10]
- Transocean workers noticed anomalous pressure readings but didn't escalate their concerns effectively [11]
- BP managers onshore approved proceeding despite test results that should have triggered additional investigation [12]
- Multiple warning signs were either not communicated between shifts or not acted upon when reported [13]

In the most telling example, the rig's blowout preventer—the last-resort safety device designed to seal the well in an emergency—had a dead battery, a leaking hydraulic system, and a disabled critical component. Each company involved assumed someone else was verifying this essential piece of equipment. [14]

As one worker later testified: "Everyone thought someone else had checked it." [14]

## Applying the Ownership Expansion Tool

When we analyze the Deepwater Horizon disaster through our Ownership Expansion Tool, the contrast with Fukushima becomes startlingly clear:

### 1. Responsibility Horizon Mapping

**Core Circle (Direct Control):**
- BP managers narrowly defined their responsibility as "following procedures" rather than ensuring safety [15]
- When anomalous test results appeared, managers interpreted them in ways that allowed operations to continue [12]
- Critical decisions were made with incomplete information because no one took responsibility for getting the full picture [16]

**Influence Circle (Indirect Control):**
- BP's relationship with contractors became adversarial rather than collaborative [17]
- Each company focused on contractual obligations rather than project success [17]
- Warning signs that crossed organizational boundaries were frequently lost [13]

**System Circle (Broader Accountability):**
- Neither BP nor its contractors considered their responsibility to coastal communities, marine ecosystems, or the broader environment [18]
- Regulatory oversight was treated as an obstacle to be managed rather than a shared responsibility for public safety [19]
- Long-term consequences were systematically discounted in favor of short-term objectives [20]

### 2. Buck Stops Nowhere Implementation

The most dramatic contrast with Fukushima's Yoshida appears in how the buck never stopped anywhere at Deepwater Horizon. Rather than someone stepping forward to take ownership, responsibility was continually passed around:

- When the negative pressure test showed problems, the toolpusher said: "That's the way it's done." [21]
- When concerns about cement quality arose, BP's engineer emailed: "Who cares, it's done, end of story, will probably be fine." [22]
- When workers questioned the interpretation of test results, they were told: "This is how the company wants it." [23]

No one said: "This is my responsibility and we're going to get it right." Instead, the dominant attitude was captured in an email from BP engineer Brett Cocales about the centralizer decision: "Who cares, it's done, end of story." [22]

### 3. Problem Value Finder Failure

Where Yoshida saw problems as opportunities to protect people and prevent disaster, BP and its contractors saw problems primarily as threats to the schedule and budget:

- When cement tests failed, they were treated as inconveniences to be explained away [24]
- When safety systems required maintenance, they were deferred to avoid delays [25]
- When workers raised concerns, they were often dismissed as being overly cautious [7]

The value of problems as warning signs was systematically ignored. As one BP manager put it in an email: "We do not want to cross into the paranoia place." [26]

### 4. Blame Institutionalization

Instead of eliminating blame to focus on solutions, the Deepwater Horizon operation institutionalized blame-shifting:

- Contractual structures incentivized companies to point fingers rather than solve problems [27]
- Communication systems broke down along company boundaries [13]
- Post-incident, each company immediately began building legal defenses rather than focusing on stopping the spill [28]

Even during congressional hearings, the finger-pointing continued. Transocean's CEO stated: "BP is the operator of this well... They specified the requirements." BP's CEO responded: "This was Transocean's rig... their systems, their people, their equipment." [29]

### 5. Ripple Mapping Blindness

Perhaps most critically, decision-makers showed a profound blindness to the ripple effects of their choices:

| Decision | Direct Impact | 2nd Degree Impact | 3rd Degree Impact | Result |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Fewer centralizers used | Saved time and money | Compromised cement job | Created potential pathway for gas | Not considered [10] |
| Skipped additional testing | Saved time | Failed to detect cement problems | Left well vulnerable to blowout | Not considered [12] |
| Disabled critical alarms | Prevented "nuisance" alarms | Reduced warning capacity | Delayed emergency response | Not considered [30] |

This myopic view—focusing only on immediate consequences while ignoring broader ripple effects—is the antithesis of expanded responsibility.

## The Human Cost of Diffused Responsibility

The consequences of this broken responsibility compass were devastating and far-reaching:

**For Workers:**
Eleven men died in the initial explosion: Jason Anderson, Dale Burkeen, Donald Clark, Stephen Curtis, Roy Wyatt Kemp, Karl Kleppinger Jr., Gordon Jones, Blair Manuel, Dewey Revette, Shane Roshto, and Adam Weise. Seventeen others were seriously injured. [31]

Mike Williams, who survived by jumping from the burning platform into the ocean 90 feet below, later testified: "We were told that we could speak up at any time. Just tell us what was wrong... But every time you said something, you were criticized. You were talked about." [1]

**For Communities:**
The spill decimated Gulf Coast fishing and tourism. One study estimated economic damages at $8.7 billion across affected industries. Fishermen lost their livelihoods. Hotel workers were laid off. Restaurant owners saw their businesses collapse. [32]

As Louisiana fisherman Darla Rooks testified: "I'm a fourth-generation fisherman. My husband's a fifth-generation fisherman... Everything we've worked for all our lives is gone. Everything." [33]

**For the Environment:**
More than 1,300 miles of shoreline were contaminated. Thousands of marine mammals and sea turtles, and over one million seabirds were estimated to have died. Lasting damage to deep-sea coral communities was documented years after the spill. [34]

**For BP:**
The company lost 55% of its market value in the aftermath. Legal settlements, fines, and cleanup costs exceeded $65 billion. Beyond the financial impact, BP's reputation was severely damaged, with effects that persist today. [35]

## The Lesson: Responsibility Cannot Be Outsourced

The Deepwater Horizon disaster teaches us that responsibility cannot be diffused, delegated, or denied without catastrophic consequences. When everyone assumes someone else is responsible, no one actually is.

This stands in stark contrast to Masao Yoshida at Fukushima, who expanded his responsibility horizon far beyond his formal role, taking personal ownership of decisions that affected an entire nation.

The key lessons from this broken compass case include:

1. **Responsibility must be claimed, not assigned**: When responsibility is treated as a contractual obligation rather than a moral imperative, critical gaps emerge

2. **Systems that diffuse responsibility create danger**: Organizational structures that incentivize blame-shifting rather than problem-solving are inherently unstable

3. **Cost-cutting that compromises safety is never economical**: BP ultimately paid more than 1,000 times what it might have spent on additional safety measures [36]

4. **Ethical leadership requires considering ripple effects**: Failing to map the broader consequences of decisions doesn't make those consequences disappear

5. **A culture of responsibility must be built before crises**: When emergencies strike, people fall back on established patterns of behavior

## Epilogue: The Lesson Not Learned

In September 2014, four and a half years after the disaster, a federal judge ruled that BP was "grossly negligent" in its handling of the Macondo well operation. The company had demonstrated "reckless" disregard for safety in pursuit of profit. [37]

Yet even in the face of this ruling, BP continued to deflect responsibility. The company issued a statement saying it "strongly disagrees" with the decision and would appeal. [38]

This final act of responsibility avoidance underscores the core failure that led to the disaster in the first place—the inability to look beyond narrow self-interest and contractual obligations to embrace a broader ethical responsibility.

Unlike Yoshida, who accepted responsibility even when it wasn't technically "his job," the leaders involved in Deepwater Horizon continued to see responsibility as something to minimize rather than maximize—with devastating consequences for all involved.
