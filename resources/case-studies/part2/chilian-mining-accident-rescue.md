# Case Study: Chilean Mining Accident Rescue
### When Caring Meant Calculated Discomfort: Leadership that Balanced Compassion with Challenge

## The Collapse That Shocked the World

At 2:00 PM on August 5, 2010, a massive section of rock collapsed inside the San José copper-gold mine near Copiapó, Chile. The mountain literally caved in, sending 700,000 tons of rock crashing through the main ramp that served as the miners' only exit route. In an instant, 33 men were trapped 2,300 feet (700 meters) below ground—buried alive with limited supplies in sweltering heat. [1]

The San José mine had a troubling safety record. Its owners, the San Esteban Primera Mining Company, had been cited for numerous safety violations in the preceding years. In 2007, an explosion at the mine killed one worker, and earlier in 2010, a miner had lost a leg in an accident. Several sections of the mine had been closed due to safety concerns, and workers had reported alarming cracking sounds in the days before the collapse. [2]

The miners who found themselves trapped had taken refuge in a 50-square-meter emergency shelter approximately the size of a small apartment. They had limited provisions: just a few days' worth of canned tuna, milk, and crackers. Their only light came from the headlamps on their helmets, with batteries that would soon die. The air temperature was around 90°F (32°C) with 90% humidity. [3]

Most mining accidents of this magnitude end in tragedy. Indeed, most such incidents never make headlines because they're quickly confirmed as recovery operations, not rescues. What unfolded in the next 69 days, however, would become one of the most extraordinary rescue operations in history—one that demonstrated the power of caring leadership that balances compassion with tough decisions, comfort with necessary discomfort, and hope with brutal honesty.

## The Minister's Dilemma: Calculating the Care Response

When news of the collapse reached Chile's President Sebastián Piñera, he faced an immediate decision. Should the government take over rescue operations, effectively admitting that the mining company wasn't up to the task? Or should they let the company handle it, potentially allowing corporate interests to dictate the response?

Piñera chose decisive intervention, dispatching his Minister of Mining, Laurence Golborne, to the site. Golborne, a businessman who had been in his political role for just five months, would face what may have been one of the most challenging leadership tests imaginable. [4]

Upon arrival, Golborne found a chaotic scene. The mining company had no rescue plan, limited resources, and was already discussing abandoning any rescue attempt. Family members had begun gathering at the mine entrance, desperate for information. Local officials seemed overwhelmed by the magnitude of the disaster. The mine itself continued to experience instability, with new collapses hampering initial assessment efforts. [5]

Within 24 hours of the collapse, Golborne faced his first major caring dilemma: Should he offer families hope that the miners might still be alive? Or should he prepare them for the more likely outcome—that their loved ones were already dead or would die before rescue was possible? The statistically probable outcome was grim; no one had ever successfully rescued miners from this depth after a collapse of this magnitude. [6]

Many leaders in Golborne's position would have chosen the path of comfort and false reassurance. Instead, he took a different approach that embodied true caring leadership: brutal honesty balanced with determined action.

In a meeting with the families, Golborne did not sugarcoat the situation: "I cannot promise that we will find them alive," he said. "What I can promise is that we will do everything humanly possible to find them." [7]

This balance of honesty and commitment would become the hallmark of Golborne's leadership throughout the crisis. He refused to offer false comfort, yet simultaneously refused to abandon hope or effort. This seemingly paradoxical approach—what we might call "hopeful realism"—created a foundation of trust with families that would prove crucial in the days ahead.

## The Tough Decision: Scientific Caring vs. Emotional Responses

When faced with a crisis of this magnitude, many leaders default to the most visible, emotionally satisfying actions—ones that show they are "doing something," regardless of effectiveness. Golborne took a fundamentally different approach, one that prioritized effective care over performative comfort.

The first rescue attempt involved sending rescuers down an intact ventilation shaft. When this proved too dangerous due to continuing instability, Golborne made the difficult decision to halt these efforts—despite the emotional appeal of direct action and the pressure from distraught families. [8]

Instead, he implemented a systematic, three-pronged approach:

1. Plan A: Drilling a small rescue shaft using a Strata 950 raise boring machine
2. Plan B: Using a Schramm T130XD oil drilling rig to bore a second hole
3. Plan C: Employing a RIG-421 drill for a third attempt [9]

This approach reflected a profound understanding that genuine caring sometimes means choosing the uncomfortable but effective path over the immediately comforting but ultimately futile one. It meant accepting the hard truth that faster but riskier methods could cost more lives, while methodical, science-based approaches offered the best chance for a successful rescue.

Golborne assembled a team of experts from Chile's state-owned copper mining company Codelco, the Chilean Navy's submarine rescue specialists, NASA experts in sustaining human life in isolated environments, and drilling specialists from around the world. This cross-disciplinary approach represented a form of intellectual humility—recognizing that caring effectively required the best expertise available, not just the most readily accessible. [10]

Throughout this process, Golborne continued his pattern of transparency with the families and the public. Rather than hiding setbacks or exaggerating progress, he provided daily briefings on exactly what was happening—including drilling problems, equipment failures, and reassessments of timelines. [11]

This commitment to truth, even when uncomfortable, created the foundation for a relationship based on authentic trust rather than wishful thinking. André Sougarret, the Chilean engineer who became the technical director of the rescue operation, later reflected: "The Minister's transparency created a foundation of trust that was essential. When we needed to make difficult decisions, the families believed we were acting in their best interest—not just telling them what they wanted to hear." [12]

## Finding Life: The Caring Paradox

After 17 days of drilling—with no confirmation that any miners had survived—Golborne faced mounting pressure. Some experts argued that continuing the expensive rescue operation was futile. Family members demanded faster action. The media questioned whether resources were being wasted on what had likely become a recovery operation rather than a rescue. [13]

On August 22, while the boring machine operator was changing a drill bit, he noticed something unusual—a strange marking on the retrieved drill bit. Someone had painted the bit with red paint while it was deep underground. This could only mean one thing: at least some of the miners were alive. [14]

Hours later, a note was retrieved, attached to the drill: "Estamos bien en el refugio los 33" ("All 33 of us are fine in the shelter"). The world celebrated what seemed like a miracle. The miners had rationed a two-day food supply to last 17 days, stretching their provisions to mere mouthfuls of tuna and sips of milk every 48 hours. [15]

For many leaders, this moment would have represented a shift to pure celebration and comfort. Golborne, however, recognized that finding the miners alive marked not the end of the challenge but a new and equally complex phase—one requiring a different form of tough caring.

Now came what psychologists would call the "caring paradox": the most compassionate actions would not necessarily be the most immediately comforting ones. True care would require making and enforcing difficult decisions that might seem harsh in the moment but were essential for the miners' survival and psychological well-being. [16]

## The Tough Love Protocol: When Caring Means Control

With the establishment of a small communication hole to the miners, the rescue team was able to send down a video camera and begin speaking with the trapped men. What they discovered was both inspiring and concerning.

The miners had organized themselves remarkably well. Luis Urzúa, the shift supervisor, had established a leadership structure and rationing system that had kept them alive when they could easily have succumbed to panic or conflict. Yet they were also in a precarious state—physically weakened, psychologically strained, and living in conditions that could quickly deteriorate. [17]

Golborne and his team recognized that genuine caring for the miners required establishing clear boundaries and protocols—many of which would feel restrictive or even cruel to both the miners and their families. Working with NASA psychologists, Chilean doctors, and other experts, they developed a comprehensive survival and support system that balanced immediate comfort against long-term welfare. [18]

This system included several elements that demonstrated the sometimes counterintuitive nature of true caring:

### 1. Rationing Comfort to Preserve Health

Although the small borehole allowed for sending down food and supplies, doctors insisted on a strict nutritional plan that initially limited the miners to liquid glucose and protein supplements, followed by small portions of solid food. Despite the miners' desperate hunger and families who wanted to send down home-cooked meals and comfort foods, the rescue team maintained rigid control over nutrition. [19]

Dr. Jorge Díaz, who helped design the protocol, explained: "The most caring thing we could do was say no to many requests. After 17 days of starvation, unrestricted eating could have killed them. Real caring meant disappointing them in the short term to keep them alive for the long term." [20]

### 2. Controlled Communication: The Burden of Truth Management

Perhaps the most emotionally challenging protocol involved communication between miners and their families. While technology allowed for written messages and eventually brief video calls, these interactions were carefully managed. Psychologists reviewed all communications to ensure they wouldn't increase miners' stress or anxiety. [21]

This meant some painful decisions. Family letters containing potentially distressing news were held back. Miners dealing with acute psychological distress were sometimes prevented from speaking with family members if psychologists felt the interaction would exacerbate their condition. [22]

Minister Golborne personally explained these restrictions to frustrated families: "I understand you want unrestricted communication with your loved ones. If I were in your position, I would want the same. But right now, what they need most is psychological stability. Sometimes, the most caring thing we can do is place boundaries around communication." [23]

This wasn't merely controlling for control's sake—it was a recognition that in crisis situations, unfiltered information can become a psychological burden too heavy to bear. The care team recognized that temporarily bearing the burden of truth management was itself an act of compassion.

### 3. Imposing Structure When Freedom Was Desired

As days stretched into weeks, the rescue team established an increasingly structured daily regimen for the miners. This included:

- Mandatory exercise periods to maintain physical capability needed for eventual rescue
- Assigned work duties to maintain the shelter and assist with rescue preparations
- Required participation in psychological counseling sessions
- Enforced sleep schedules to maintain circadian rhythms despite constant darkness
- Designated roles and responsibilities within the group [24]

When some miners resisted these structures, preferring to cope in their own ways, the response wasn't to accommodate individual preferences but to firmly maintain the protocols. This represented an understanding that genuine care sometimes means imposing beneficial structure rather than permitting harmful freedom. [25]

One miner, Víctor Zamora, later said: "Sometimes we hated the exercise requirements and the work assignments. We wanted to be left alone in our misery. But looking back, those structures kept us physically and mentally alive. It was caring that looked like control." [26]

## The Leadership Burden: Carrying the Weight When Others Cannot

Throughout the ordeal, Golborne demonstrated another aspect of caring leadership: willingness to personally bear the heaviest psychological burdens rather than diffusing responsibility or offloading difficult tasks to subordinates.

Three examples stand out:

### 1. The Impossible Timeline Conversation

As drilling progressed, technical experts provided Golborne with a realistic timeline for rescue: it would likely take 3-4 months to reach the miners. This news was devastating—such a long period in isolation could lead to serious physical and psychological deterioration, possibly even deaths underground. [27]

Golborne did not delegate the task of communicating this timeline to technical spokespeople or subordinates. He personally met with families to deliver the news, directly absorbing their grief, anger, and fears. When one family member shouted, "My brother will die down there before Christmas!" Golborne didn't offer empty reassurances. Instead, he acknowledged the possibility while reaffirming absolute commitment to the effort. [28]

This willingness to personally deliver and absorb difficult news represents a profound form of caring—taking on emotional burdens so others don't have to carry them alone.

### 2. The Letter of Last Resort

As contingency planning, Golborne requested that each miner write what became known as a "letter of last resort"—a final message to their families in case rescue attempts failed. This request acknowledged the reality that despite best efforts, some or all miners might not survive. [29]

Rather than having technical staff or psychologists make this request, Golborne personally asked the miners to write these letters during a private communication. He explained both the practical reasons and the emotional reality of why such preparation was necessary.

"Writing that request was the hardest message I ever composed," Golborne later said. "But asking others to deliver such news would have been an abdication of my responsibility as a leader." [30]

### 3. The Life-and-Death Decision Protocol

Perhaps the most ethically challenging aspect of the rescue operation was establishing a protocol for who would be rescued first when the escape capsule was finally ready. Contrary to usual mining rescue procedures (which typically prioritize the strongest or most skilled), the team developed a more nuanced approach that considered multiple factors:

- Physical condition (both strongest and weakest had special considerations)
- Psychological stability
- Technical skills that might be needed during the rescue
- Special health needs
- Ability to provide useful feedback to improve the process for subsequent rescues [31]

Golborne not only participated in developing this protocol but insisted on being present at the mine during the entire rescue operation—a 48-hour period without sleep—to personally bear witness to the consequences of these life-and-death decisions. [32]

## The Turning Point: Balancing Hope with Honesty

As drilling continued, the rescue operation experienced both progress and setbacks. Drill bits broke. Boreholes went off course. Equipment failed in the harsh conditions. Each setback created a leadership challenge: how to maintain hope while being honest about obstacles.

Golborne's approach to this balance became a master class in ethical communication during crisis. Instead of hiding problems or exaggerating success, he adopted a three-part communication framework:

1. Acknowledge the specific setback or challenge honestly
2. Explain the technical response being implemented
3. Place the setback in the larger context of the overall rescue effort [33]

This approach avoided both toxic positivity ("Everything's fine!") and demoralizing pessimism ("We're facing insurmountable problems"). Instead, it offered what psychologists call "realistic hope"—acknowledging difficulties while maintaining conviction in the overall mission.

Dr. Alberto Iturra, the lead psychologist for the operation, noted: "The Minister's communication style became our model for how to talk with the miners themselves. It wasn't about making people feel good in the moment; it was about building sustainable psychological resilience through honest but hopeful communication." [34]

## The Rescue: Calibrating Care to Individual Needs

On October 9, 2010, after 65 days of drilling, the Plan B borehole finally broke through to the miners' refuge. The rescue phase could begin, but it would require another demonstration of care calibrated to individual needs rather than one-size-fits-all compassion.

The custom-built rescue capsule—named "Phoenix" to symbolize rebirth—could accommodate only one person at a time for the 15-20 minute journey through nearly half a mile of solid rock. Each trip carried significant risks: the capsule could become stuck, the miner could experience medical complications during ascent, or a new collapse could occur during the operation. [35]

Drawing on detailed medical and psychological assessments, the rescue team developed a personalized extraction plan for each miner, with specific protocols for:

- Pre-journey medical preparation
- Customized anxiety management techniques
- Personal items allowed in the capsule
- Communication during the journey
- Immediate medical interventions upon arrival
- Family reunion protocols [36]

This individualized approach represented the antithesis of bureaucratic, standardized care. It recognized that while all miners faced similar physical circumstances, their unique physical conditions, psychological profiles, and family situations required tailored support.

Luis Urzúa, the shift supervisor who had maintained order underground, expressed a desire to be the last miner rescued—maintaining his leadership responsibility until everyone else was safe. Although this created additional risk for Urzúa himself, the rescue team honored this request, recognizing that respecting his sense of duty was itself a form of care. [37]

In contrast, Mario Sepúlveda, a miner whose psychological assessment showed high anxiety about small spaces, was moved up in the rescue order after doctors determined that additional days of waiting might compromise his ability to endure the claustrophobic rescue capsule. [38]

This calibrated approach reflected a sophisticated understanding that caring leadership must be responsive to individual differences rather than applying a single standard of "care" to all.

## The First Ascent: Ethical Care in the Global Spotlight

At 11:19 PM on October 12, 2010, Florencio Ávalos, selected as the first miner to attempt the journey to the surface, entered the Phoenix capsule and began his ascent. The entire operation was broadcast live to a global audience estimated at more than 1 billion viewers. [39]

The rescue team had faced a difficult ethical decision regarding this media coverage. On one hand, the miners and their families deserved privacy during a profoundly personal moment. On the other, the Chilean government had made significant investments in the rescue, and the global attention created accountability and ensured continued support. [40]

Golborne and his team navigated this dilemma through another balanced approach to care:

1. Each miner could choose whether to be publicly visible during their rescue
2. Medical assessments would remain private
3. Initial family reunions would occur away from cameras
4. Miners would not be required to speak to media
5. A protective screen could be deployed if medical interventions were needed [41]

This approach recognized that caring doesn't mean making all choices for others but rather creating a framework where individual agency can be exercised within appropriate boundaries.

As the Phoenix capsule emerged from the rescue shaft with Ávalos inside, Golborne maintained his characteristic balance of emotion and professionalism. While allowing himself to embrace the miner—an authentic human moment—he quickly refocused on the 32 men still underground, demonstrating that caring leadership remains vigilant until the mission is fully accomplished. [42]

## The Complete Rescue: From Crisis Leadership to Transition Care

Over the next 22 hours, all 33 miners were successfully brought to the surface. The final miner, Luis Urzúa, emerged at 9:55 PM on October 13, 2010. After 69 days underground, "Los 33" as they had become known, were all alive and in relatively good health—a outcome that had seemed nearly impossible when the crisis began. [43]

For many leaders, this triumphant moment would have represented mission completion. Golborne understood, however, that the miners' journey was far from over. True caring meant planning for their transition back to normal life—a process that would carry its own psychological and practical challenges.

The rescue team had developed a comprehensive transition program that included:

- Immediate medical assessment and intervention
- Financial management support (the miners had received numerous financial offers)
- Media training and protection from exploitation
- Family reintegration counseling
- Long-term psychological support
- Assistance with career transitions for those unable or unwilling to return to mining [44]

This forward-looking care reflected an understanding that genuine compassion extends beyond the immediate crisis to long-term wellbeing.

In his final press conference at the mine site, Golborne articulated this philosophy: "Our responsibility doesn't end when the last miner reaches the surface. Real care means supporting these men and their families through the challenges of returning to a world that has changed around them, and to lives that have been profoundly transformed by this experience." [45]

## The Caring Leadership Legacy

The Chilean mine rescue stands as one of the great success stories of modern crisis management. Beyond the technical achievement, it represents a masterclass in caring leadership that balances compassion with tough decisions, immediate comfort with long-term welfare, and hope with unflinching realism.

Several key leadership lessons emerge from Golborne's approach:

### 1. Truth as the Foundation of Authentic Care

Throughout the crisis, Golborne maintained an unwavering commitment to truth-telling, even when falsehoods might have offered temporary comfort. This created a foundation of trust that supported difficult decisions and uncomfortable protocols.

As Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson noted in her analysis of the rescue: "The Chilean rescue operation demonstrates that psychological safety—the belief that one can speak up without being punished or humiliated—depends first and foremost on leadership that insists on truth over comfort." [46]

### 2. Expertise as an Expression of Caring

Rather than relying on general management skills or political authority, Golborne assembled world-class technical and psychological expertise. This represented an understanding that in life-or-death situations, caring means providing the very best resources available, regardless of organizational boundaries or national pride.

Dr. James Polk, NASA's deputy chief medical officer who assisted with the rescue, observed: "The Chilean leadership demonstrated that real caring isn't about who gets credit or who's in charge. It's about bringing the right expertise to bear on the problem, regardless of source." [47]

### 3. Balancing Individual Dignity with Necessary Control

Throughout the ordeal, the rescue operation maintained a delicate balance between respecting the miners' autonomy and implementing necessary controls for their welfare. This reflected an understanding that genuine care sometimes requires making decisions for others—not because they lack dignity or agency, but because specific circumstances require protective boundaries.

Psychologist Dr. Alberto Iturra explained this approach: "Our care was not paternalistic in the sense of believing the miners couldn't think for themselves. Rather, it recognized that extreme circumstances create unique vulnerabilities that require protective boundaries within which dignity can be preserved." [48]

### 4. Carrying Personal Leadership Burdens

Throughout the crisis, Golborne demonstrated willingness to personally bear the heaviest burdens of leadership rather than delegating difficult messages or decisions. This "leadership by absorption" represented a profound form of caring—taking on emotional weight so others didn't have to carry it alone.

Former Chilean President Sebastián Piñera later reflected: "What made Golborne's leadership exceptional wasn't just his decision-making but his willingness to personally absorb the hardest aspects of the crisis. He carried burdens so others could maintain hope." [49]

### 5. Seeing Beyond the Immediate Crisis

From the beginning, Golborne and his team planned not just for rescue but for recovery and reintegration. This long-term perspective is often missing in crisis leadership, which tends to focus exclusively on immediate survival rather than sustained wellbeing.

Harvard Kennedy School leadership professor Dutch Leonard observed: "The Chilean rescue demonstrated care across multiple time horizons—addressing immediate survival needs while simultaneously planning for psychological recovery and life reintegration." [50]

## The Personal Cost of Leadership Care

True caring leadership often comes with personal costs, and Golborne's case was no exception. The 24/7 nature of the crisis, the weight of life-or-death decisions, and the intense global scrutiny created significant personal strain.

During the 69-day ordeal, Golborne:
- Lost 17 pounds from stress and irregular meals
- Averaged less than 5 hours of sleep per night 
- Was physically present at the mine site for 58 of the 69 days
- Personally absorbed grieving, angry reactions from family members
- Faced death threats when difficult decisions were necessary [51]

This personal toll reflects a reality often overlooked in leadership literature: genuine caring frequently requires personal sacrifice. Golborne's willingness to accept these costs represents another dimension of his leadership approach—an understanding that caring for others sometimes means subordinating one's own comfort and welfare.

## Conclusion: The Triumph of Balanced Care

The successful rescue of all 33 miners after 69 days underground stands as a testament not just to technical ingenuity but to a profound understanding of what genuine caring leadership entails. 

In contrast to approaches that equate caring with comfort, avoid difficult truths, or prioritize short-term emotional relief over long-term welfare, Golborne and his team demonstrated a more nuanced understanding: that authentic care often requires balancing compassion with hard decisions, empathy with boundaries, and hope with unflinching realism.

The true indicator of this leadership approach's success wasn't just that the miners survived but how they survived—with dignity intact, psychological resources preserved, and a foundation for recovery established.

As one miner, Alex Vega, later reflected: "What they did wasn't always what we wanted in the moment. Sometimes it felt controlling or unnecessarily strict. But looking back, I understand now—they cared enough to do what was needed, not just what felt good." [52]

This may be the ultimate test of caring leadership: not whether it provides immediate comfort, but whether it creates the conditions for long-term flourishing—even when that requires uncomfortable interventions, difficult boundaries, and hard truths.

In a world that increasingly equates caring with comfort and compassion with acquiescence, the Chilean mine rescue stands as a powerful reminder that sometimes, the most caring thing a leader can do is embrace the necessary discomfort of genuine responsibility.
