# Case Study: Captain Sullenberger and Flight 1549
### Trustworthiness Under Pressure

## The Moment Trustworthiness Was Tested

"We're going to be in the Hudson."

These six words, spoken with remarkable calm by Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger to air traffic control at 3:29 PM on January 15, 2009, marked the beginning of what would become known as the "Miracle on the Hudson." [1]

Just 208 seconds earlier, US Airways Flight 1549 had struck a flock of Canada geese shortly after takeoff from New York's LaGuardia Airport, causing catastrophic failure of both engines. At 3,000 feet over one of the most densely populated areas in America, with 155 souls aboard an engineless Airbus A320, Captain Sullenberger faced an impossible choice: attempt to reach a runway miles away, or attempt something no commercial pilot had ever successfully done—an emergency landing on the Hudson River. [2]

What followed would become a defining case study in trustworthiness under extreme pressure—an example of how decades of preparation, unwavering commitment to principles, and extraordinary clarity in crisis can create trustworthiness that literally saves lives.

This wasn't just a story of exceptional piloting skill, although that was certainly present. More fundamentally, it was a demonstration of how genuine trustworthiness manifests when tested to its limits—not through grand declarations, but through consistent actions aligned with core principles. Sullenberger's handling of Flight 1549 revealed how trustworthiness built over decades can create the foundation for decisive action in moments when there is no time to deliberate. [3]

## The Lifetime of Preparation

Chesley Burnett Sullenberger III's journey toward that fateful moment began long before he stepped into the cockpit of Flight 1549. Born in 1951 in Denison, Texas, Sullenberger's fascination with flight started early. He took his first flying lessons at 16, then graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1973. As an Air Force pilot, he flew F-4 Phantom II fighter jets, attaining the rank of captain. After leaving the Air Force in 1980, he joined Pacific Southwest Airlines, which later became US Airways. [4]

Yet Sullenberger's preparation extended far beyond accumulating flight hours. Throughout his career, he distinguished himself through a relentless commitment to safety and expertise:

- He became an accident investigator for the Air Line Pilots Association
- He helped develop new safety protocols adopted across the airline industry
- He founded Safety Reliability Methods, Inc., a consulting firm focused on safety improvement
- He earned a master's degree in Industrial Psychology from Purdue University
- He studied the psychology of error management and crisis decision-making
- He published scholarly articles on accident investigations and safety procedures [5]

This multidimensional preparation reflected Sullenberger's fundamental understanding of what creates trustworthiness in high-risk domains: not just technical competence, but deep systems understanding and an unwavering commitment to principles.

"For thousands of hours, I've been in simulators, practicing emergencies. Often when you look at accidents, they are a culmination of many, many events—human performance, mechanical issues, weather," Sullenberger later reflected. "I didn't have time to consult with experts or manuals, there was just me and my co-pilot and all of our collective experience. I needed to make a decision, to choose the least bad option." [6]

That collective experience wasn't merely technical. It included a deeply ethical dimension—a set of principles about responsibility and duty of care that would prove decisive in crisis.

## The Core Principles: Sullenberger's Non-Negotiables

What distinguished Sullenberger from many technically competent pilots was his explicit articulation of the principles that guided his approach to aviation. Long before Flight 1549, he had developed a clear set of non-negotiable commitments:

1. **Safety is always the absolute priority**
   "In aviation, the primary focus must always be safety. Everything else—schedule, convenience, cost—is secondary." [7]

2. **Continuous learning is a professional obligation**
   "Expertise isn't static. The moment you stop actively learning and improving is the moment you begin to become less safe." [8]

3. **Crew coordination is essential, not optional**
   "The safest cockpit is one where hierarchy doesn't prevent communication and where every crew member feels responsible for speaking up." [9]

4. **Preparation for worst-case scenarios is a responsibility**
   "When problems arise, you must already have thought about them deeply. There won't be time to develop a philosophy in an emergency." [10]

5. **Humility about human limitations is crucial**
   "We must design systems that account for inevitable human error rather than expecting perfect performance." [11]

These principles weren't abstract ideals—they were practical commitments that shaped how Sullenberger approached every flight, including the routine New York to Charlotte route on January 15, 2009. His trustworthiness wasn't manufactured in the moment of crisis; it was revealed by it. [12]

## First Officer Jeffrey Skiles: The Essential Partner

The story of Flight 1549 can't be told without recognizing the crucial role of First Officer Jeffrey Skiles. With over 20,000 flight hours himself, Skiles was an experienced aviator, though he had only recently transitioned to the Airbus A320 after years flying Boeing aircraft. Flight 1549 was their first time flying together. [13]

This detail is significant to understanding the trustworthiness dynamics of what followed. In a crisis, effective teamwork depends on mutual trust that must often be established instantly rather than built gradually. What enabled Sullenberger and Skiles to function as a cohesive unit despite their limited history together were shared professional values and clear role understanding. [14]

"Though we had never met before that trip began, I knew immediately that Jeff was a consummate professional," Sullenberger later recalled. "When the crisis struck, we didn't need to have a long relationship to work effectively together. We had something more important—a shared commitment to following procedures, communicating clearly, and prioritizing the safety of our passengers above all else." [15]

This shared professional ethic created what psychologists call "swift trust"—the ability to collaborate effectively without extended relationship building. In high-risk domains where teams must come together quickly, this form of trust becomes essential. Sullenberger and Skiles demonstrated how shared principles create the foundation for such trust. [16]

## 208 Seconds: Trustworthiness in Action

At 3:25 PM Eastern Time, US Airways Flight 1549 was cleared for takeoff from LaGuardia Airport's Runway 4. On board were 150 passengers and 5 crew members. The weather was clear with a temperature of 20°F (-7°C), and the flight was expected to be routine. Captain Sullenberger was the pilot flying, with First Officer Skiles handling communications. [17]

The crisis began less than two minutes after takeoff:

**3:27:11 PM**: At 2,818 feet above ground level, the aircraft struck a flock of Canada geese. Passengers heard loud bangs, and the cockpit windscreen was momentarily obscured by bird remains. Both engines rapidly lost power. [18]

**3:27:13 PM**: Sullenberger took control of both flying and communications, saying simply to Skiles, "My aircraft." Skiles responded with the proper protocol confirmation: "Your aircraft." [19]

This brief exchange illustrates the first element of Sullenberger's trustworthiness in action: absolute clarity in roles and communication. Even as alarms blared and the situation deteriorated, his communication remained precise and unambiguous. [20]

**3:27:28 PM**: Sullenberger contacted air traffic control: "Mayday, mayday, mayday. Uh, this is Cactus fifteen-forty-nine. Hit birds. We've lost thrust in both engines. We're turning back towards LaGuardia." [21]

This communication demonstrated the second element of his trustworthiness: transparent information sharing. Sullenberger didn't minimize the situation or create false assurances. He clearly articulated the crisis while keeping his voice measured. [22]

While communicating with air traffic control, Sullenberger was simultaneously:
- Attempting to restart the engines
- Evaluating their glide path and options
- Running the emergency engine restart checklist
- Calculating distances to possible landing sites
- Managing aircraft energy (altitude and speed) [23]

Air traffic control offered Runway 13 at LaGuardia, but Sullenberger's quick mental calculations told him they couldn't make it. He then considered Teterboro Airport in New Jersey:

**3:28:05 PM**: Controller: "I can get you runway one-nine at Teterboro."
**3:28:10 PM**: Sullenberger: "We can't do it."
**3:28:11 PM**: Controller: "Okay, which runway would you like at Teterboro?"
**3:28:14 PM**: Sullenberger: "We're gonna be in the Hudson." [24]

This exchange reveals the third element of Sullenberger's trustworthiness: the courage to deliver difficult truths. Rather than projecting false confidence or attempting what he assessed as impossible, he clearly communicated the reality of their situation. [25]

As Sullenberger later explained: "I needed to touch down with the wings exactly level. I needed to touch down with the nose slightly up. I needed to touch down at a descent rate that was survivable. And I needed to touch down just above our minimum flying speed but not below it. And I needed to make all these things happen simultaneously." [26]

At approximately 3:30 PM, Flight 1549 ditched in the Hudson River near 48th Street in Manhattan. The water landing was executed with remarkable precision—wings level, nose slightly up, at the minimum speed necessary to maintain control. The touchdown was hard but survivable, and the aircraft remained largely intact. [27]

## After Impact: Leadership Beyond the Landing

Trustworthiness isn't demonstrated only in the moment of crisis but in the actions that follow. After the aircraft came to rest on the Hudson, Sullenberger's leadership continued to manifest in several key ways:

**Methodical Evacuation Leadership**: 
Sullenberger immediately ordered "Evacuate" over the PA system. He then left his seat and moved through the aircraft, giving clear directives to flight attendants and checking that all passengers were moving toward exits. As water entered the rear of the aircraft, he redirected passengers forward. [28]

**Thorough Verification Before Self-Preservation**:
Despite rising water and the risk of sinking, Sullenberger walked the aisle of the aircraft twice, confirming no one remained before exiting himself. He was the last person to leave the aircraft. [29]

"I walked down the aisle in the ever-increasing angle of the plane. The water was coming in through the back. It was nearly waist-deep. It was very quiet—the only sounds were the shouts of the first responders from the boats, 'Come this way!' I made one last check. There were no more passengers on the plane. As I swung my legs over the side of the window to get out, I said a prayer: 'Please God, don't let anyone else die.'" [30]

**Clear Information for First Responders**:
Upon leaving the aircraft, Sullenberger immediately informed rescue personnel about the number of souls on board and provided other critical information to coordinate the rescue operation. [31]

**Continued Leadership During Rescue**:
As passengers stood on the wings in freezing temperatures, Sullenberger helped coordinate with rescue boats, ensuring orderly transfer and prioritizing those in greatest need. [32]

All 155 people aboard survived, with only minor injuries reported. The National Transportation Safety Board later concluded that "the success of this ditching was the result of good airmanship and outstanding cockpit resource management by the flight crew." [33]

## The Trustworthiness Revealed: Applying the Frameworks

Sullenberger's handling of Flight 1549 provides a powerful case study for understanding how genuine trustworthiness manifests under extreme pressure. Applying our trustworthiness frameworks reveals how each element contributed to the successful outcome.

### The Trust Equation: Sullenberger's Perfect Balance

Using David Maister's Trust Equation (Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation), we can analyze Sullenberger's trustworthiness along each dimension: [34]

#### 1. Credibility: "I can believe what you say"

Sullenberger's credibility derived from multiple sources:

- **Technical Expertise**: His 20,000+ flight hours and extensive training created foundational credibility
- **Verified Knowledge**: His publications on safety and accident investigation demonstrated deep domain expertise
- **Communication Precision**: His clear, accurate communications during the crisis reinforced his credibility [35]

As passenger Beth McHugh later recalled: "When he came on the PA and said 'Brace for impact,' there was something in his voice—it wasn't panic, it was calm authority. I thought, 'This man knows exactly what he's doing.'" [36]

#### 2. Reliability: "I can depend on your consistent actions"

Reliability in crisis stems from consistent demonstration of values and processes:

- **Procedural Adherence**: Sullenberger followed emergency protocols precisely despite extreme time pressure
- **Values Consistency**: His actions aligned perfectly with his long-articulated safety principles
- **Predictable Leadership**: His behavior after landing (ensuring all passengers evacuated before he did) demonstrated consistent prioritization of others' safety [37]

Donna Dent, a flight attendant on 1549, noted: "Even in that unimaginable situation, he was executing the procedures we had trained on. That consistency gave us confidence to do our jobs." [38]

#### 3. Intimacy: "I can safely share concerns with you"

While intimacy typically develops over time, Sullenberger created psychological safety even with people he had just met:

- **Empathetic Communication**: His calm voice and clear directions reduced passenger panic
- **Transparent Information Sharing**: He didn't sugarcoat the situation but communicated honestly
- **Approachable Leadership**: During evacuation, passengers reported feeling they could voice concerns [39]

Passenger Barry Leonard later said: "He created an environment where even though we were terrified, we felt we could trust his directions. That's extraordinary given we'd never met him before that day." [40]

#### 4. Self-Orientation: "You focus on my needs, not yours"

Perhaps most remarkably, Sullenberger demonstrated minimal self-orientation throughout the crisis:

- **Passenger-Centric Decision Making**: His choice of the Hudson was based on maximizing survival chances
- **Risk Acceptance**: He prioritized passenger safety over personal risk during evacuation
- **Credit Sharing**: In all post-incident communications, he emphasized the team effort [41]

"A fundamental understanding of servant leadership is that true authority comes from putting others first," noted leadership scholar Warren Bennis in analyzing Sullenberger's actions. "He embodied this by being the last person off that aircraft." [42]

### The Non-Negotiable Audit: Principles in Action

The Non-Negotiable Audit examines how leaders maintain their core principles under pressure. Sullenberger's actions demonstrated unwavering commitment to his pre-established non-negotiables: [43]

**Safety as Absolute Priority**: When offered runway options at LaGuardia and Teterboro, Sullenberger rejected them based on his assessment of risk, choosing instead the Hudson—a more survivable option though more damaging to the aircraft. [44]

**Continuous Learning as Professional Obligation**: Sullenberger's knowledge of previous water landings, including Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961's partial success and Air Florida's Flight 90's failures, informed his approach. [45]

**Crew Coordination as Essential**: Despite being their first flight together, Sullenberger and Skiles maintained clear communication throughout. When Sullenberger took over communications, it was done with explicit verbal confirmation. [46]

**Preparation for Worst-Case Scenarios**: Though no commercial airline pilot had successfully ditched in a major waterway, Sullenberger had mentally rehearsed such scenarios. "I had thought about this sort of event throughout my career," he later explained. [47]

**Humility About Human Limitations**: Recognizing the impossibility of reaching an airport, Sullenberger didn't attempt to be heroic beyond what was possible—a crucial insight that saved lives. [48]

As psychologist Karl Weick noted in his analysis: "What makes Sullenberger remarkable isn't that he invented new principles during the crisis, but that he adhered to his existing principles despite extreme pressure to compromise them." [49]

### The Antifragile Trust Barbell: Rigid Principles, Flexible Implementation

The Antifragile Trust Barbell concept suggests that trustworthiness requires unwavering core principles combined with flexible implementation approaches. Sullenberger's management of Flight 1549 exemplified this balance perfectly: [50]

#### Rigid Safety Principles:
- Unwavering commitment to maximizing survival chances
- Absolute dedication to checking the entire aircraft before evacuating
- Non-negotiable adherence to clear communication protocols [51]

#### Flexible Implementation:
- Adapting to the unique circumstances of a water landing
- Modifying standard emergency procedures for a river ditching
- Improvising evacuation approaches as water levels changed [52]

This barbell approach—rigid in principles but flexible in tactics—enabled Sullenberger to maintain trustworthiness while adapting to unprecedented circumstances. [53]

Aviation psychologist Sidney Dekker observed: "What makes Sullenberger's response so instructive is this perfect balance—he knew exactly which aspects of his training were principle-based and therefore non-negotiable, and which aspects required adaptation to the unique circumstances." [54]

### The Core-Periphery Audit: Correct Classification Under Pressure

The Core-Periphery Audit helps leaders distinguish between non-negotiable core values and peripheral elements that can adapt to different contexts. In the 208 seconds of crisis, Sullenberger demonstrated remarkable clarity about this distinction: [55]

#### Correctly Classified Core Elements:
- Protecting human life above all other considerations
- Maintaining aircraft control throughout the emergency
- Ensuring complete passenger evacuation [56]

#### Correctly Classified Peripherals:
- Saving the aircraft from damage
- Maintaining normal communication protocols
- Following standard approach procedures [57]

This clarity about core versus peripheral concerns enabled Sullenberger to make rapid decisions without second-guessing. As he later explained: "I knew that the most important thing—the only thing that really mattered—was bringing those people home to their families." [58]

## Beyond the Miracle: Trustworthiness as Ongoing Practice

In the years following Flight 1549, Sullenberger had the opportunity to demonstrate another aspect of trustworthiness: consistency over time. Rather than simply enjoying his hero status, he used his platform to advocate for the systems and principles that enable aviation safety: [59]

**Advocating for Pilot Working Conditions**:
Testifying before Congress, Sullenberger highlighted how pilot fatigue, inadequate training, and poor compensation threatened safety: "I am worried that the airline piloting profession will not be able to continue to attract the best and the brightest." [60]

**Speaking Truth to Power on Industry Practices**:
When airlines began reducing training hours, Sullenberger publicly criticized the practice: "We're currently experiencing a critical shortage of both airline pilots and aviation maintenance technicians. Whenever you have high demand and short supply, there are immense economic pressures to lower standards." [61]

**Maintaining Principle-Based Positions**:
When asked to endorse products or companies that didn't align with his values, Sullenberger consistently declined, despite significant financial incentives. [62]

**Advocating for System-Level Safety**:
After the Boeing 737 MAX crashes, Sullenberger testified before Congress about the systemic failures involved: "These crashes are demonstrable evidence that our current system of aircraft design and certification has failed us. These accidents should never have happened." [63]

This consistent behavior reinforced Sullenberger's trustworthiness beyond the single event of Flight 1549. As ethicist Joseph Badaracco noted: "The true test of character isn't a single heroic moment, but the pattern of choices made day after day, especially when those choices come with personal costs." [64]

## The Legacy: Institutional Trust Building

Perhaps the most significant aspect of Sullenberger's impact was how his actions affected institutional trust—not just in him personally, but in the aviation system more broadly.

The "Miracle on the Hudson" occurred during a period of extreme economic pressure on airlines, with many cutting costs, reducing training, and pushing pilots to work longer hours with less rest. Public trust in the airline industry had been declining. [65]

Sullenberger's actions and subsequent advocacy helped counterbalance this trend by:

1. **Demonstrating the Value of Experience**: His 20,000+ hours of flight time highlighted the importance of experienced pilots, countering industry moves toward minimizing experience requirements. [66]

2. **Showing the Return on Safety Investment**: The successful outcome validated the importance of intensive training and safety systems, making visible their value. [67]

3. **Humanizing Aviation Professionals**: His articulate explanation of pilot decision-making helped the public understand the human dimensions of aviation safety. [68]

4. **Advocating for System Improvements**: His testimony on pilot fatigue contributed to new FAA regulations on duty time limitations and required rest periods. [69]

Airline Captain John Cox observed: "Sullenberger did more than save 155 lives that day. He showed the public what professional airmanship looks like, and he gave voice to the thousands of pilots who quietly maintain these standards every day." [70]

## Lessons in Trustworthiness: What Leaders Can Learn

The Flight 1549 case offers several profound insights about trustworthiness that apply across leadership contexts:

1. **Trustworthiness is built long before it's tested**: Sullenberger's lifetime of preparation created the foundation for his 208 seconds of decisive action. True trustworthiness is developed through consistent investment in expertise and principle-based decision-making. [71]

2. **Clear communication is essential to trustworthiness**: Throughout the crisis, Sullenberger's communication was clear, accurate, and appropriate. He didn't minimize the danger, exaggerate capabilities, or create false assurances. [72]

3. **Self-orientation undermines trustworthiness**: Sullenberger consistently placed others' needs above his own, most dramatically by being the last person to leave the aircraft. This low self-orientation is a hallmark of trustworthy leadership. [73]

4. **Trustworthiness requires appropriate confidence**: Sullenberger demonstrated confidence in his abilities without overconfidence in what was possible. This balanced self-assessment is crucial for trustworthy decision-making. [74]

5. **Principle-based decisions enable rapid action**: Because Sullenberger had clear, internalized principles, he could make complex decisions rapidly without second-guessing. When core values are clear, decisions flow from them naturally even under extreme pressure. [75]

As leadership scholar James Kouzes noted: "What makes the Flight 1549 case so instructive is that it shows trustworthiness isn't mainly about charisma or inspiration. It's about competence, character, and consistency—doing the right thing when it matters most." [76]

## Conclusion: Trustworthiness That Strengthens Under Pressure

The most remarkable aspect of Captain Sullenberger's trustworthiness is how it strengthened rather than weakened under extreme pressure. While many leaders become less trustworthy when stressed—cutting corners, obscuring information, or prioritizing self-protection—Sullenberger exhibited the opposite pattern. [77]

This antifragile quality—becoming more aligned with core values under pressure rather than less—is the hallmark of genuine trustworthiness. It can't be manufactured in the moment but emerges from lifelong preparation and commitment to principles. [78]

As Sullenberger himself reflected: "For 42 years, I've been making small, regular deposits in this bank of experience, education and training. And on January 15, the balance was sufficient so that I could make a very large withdrawal." [79]

For leaders in any field, Flight 1549 offers a powerful reminder: trustworthiness isn't primarily about what you say, but what you do when every action counts. When lives, organizations, or missions are on the line, leadership trustworthiness becomes not just a virtue but a necessity.

The legacy of US Airways Flight 1549 isn't just that 155 people survived against overwhelming odds. It's that trustworthiness, systematically developed and consistently applied, can create extraordinary outcomes even in the most desperate circumstances.
