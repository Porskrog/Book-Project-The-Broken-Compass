## Case Study Development Guidelines

When developing new case studies:

1. Aim for a mix of positive and negative examples
2. Include cases from diverse industries, geographical regions, and organizational types
3. Ensure each case clearly illustrates the relevant concept from the chapter
4. Where possible, include quantifiable outcomes and specific leadership actions
5. Consider developing companion teaching notes for workshops or classroom use
6. For cases involving real organizations and individuals, focus on publicly available information or obtain permission

## Using These Case Studies

These case studies can be used:

1. As standalone learning resources
2. As supplements to the book's content
3. In workshop or classroom settings
4. For personal reflection on leadership challenges
5. As templates for readers to analyze their own ethical dilemmas
