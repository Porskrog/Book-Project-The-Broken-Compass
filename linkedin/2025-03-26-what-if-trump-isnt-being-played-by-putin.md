What if Donald Trump isn’t being played by Vladimir Putin - but is playing us?

On March 19th, The Economist framed the Putin - Trump call as a trap. A fantasy of peace. A show of weakness.

But what if the real weakness isn't Trump's?

What if Ukraine isn’t a bargaining chip, but a deliverable?
What if the “fantasy” of U.S.–Russia cooperation isn’t a trap Trump walked into - but a story he’s helping sell?
And what if the rest of us are still pretending the rules haven't changed?

This isn’t a partisan question. It’s a leadership one.

What does it mean when a global power is run by someone who doesn’t play by the old rules of alliances, values, or loyalty?

I wrote a bold counterpoint to The Economist’s article.

Read it. Reflect on it. Share it.

Because sometimes, the trap isn’t where we think it is.
