## The Broken Compass: Ethical Leadership for Value Creation in a Chaotic World

**Søren Porskrog**

### Abstract

In an era of collapsing global order, institutional fragmentation, and deliberate chaos, traditional ethical frameworks are failing leaders. "The Broken Compass" provides a desperately needed guide for navigating complex ethical challenges in today's turbulent environment. Drawing from real-world cases like Deepwater Horizon and Fukushima, the book introduces the concepts of antifragile ethics and expanded responsibility - approaches that become stronger, not weaker, under pressure.

Unlike conventional ethics books that offer abstract principles or simplistic answers, this work delivers practical tools like the Non-Negotiable Audit, the Ethical Decision Matrix, and the Ownership Expansion Tool. Through a provocative, occasionally uncomfortable examination of ethical leadership failures and successes, readers learn to develop personal ethical strength that thrives in chaos rather than breaking under it.

The timing is critical. As leaders face unprecedented challenges from technological advancement, institutional fragmentation, and global uncertainty, traditional approaches to ethical decision-making have proven inadequate. "The Broken Compass" bridges the gap between abstract ethical philosophy and practical leadership needs, offering a framework for ethical leadership that strengthens through adversity rather than collapsing under pressure.
